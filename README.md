# Whakaoko (verb. to listen)

A service for aggregating 3rd party content from RSS feeds into an easy to consume local JSON or RSS feed.

Provides a [local API](src/main/resources/static/openapi.json) for other applications to consume 
the aggregated content via a single HTTP/JSON interface.

## Good at

Very good at the use case of aggregating a list of related RSS feeds into a combined channel.


## Features

### Resolving short URLs

Expands feedburner and tinyurl URLs into canonical full URLs.


### Minimises HTTP traffic

Uses etag and last modified header conditional GETs to minimise traffic.

The feedcache documentation on [implementing conditional HTTP GET](https://feedcache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/index.html#implementing-conditional-http-get) describes the technique well.

### GeoRSS aware

Preserves GeoRSS location data.

## Implementation

Kotlin application. 
MongoDB 3.6 is used for storage. 
Memcached for caching of resolved short URLs.


## Concepts

### Subscriptions

A subscription represents a source of 3rd party content.
The following sources are currently supported.

- RSS / ATOM feeds

Content, media RSS and geoRSS tags.


### Channels

A channel is a collection of related subscriptions.
The content from each subscription in the channel is aggregated together.



### Output formats

Content is output is either JSON or RSS.

The RSS format encodes images as media RSS tags and geotags as geoRSS tags.

# Setup

## Run locally

Start Mongo and Memcached dependencies as Docker images:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

Run using the Spring Boot plugin:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The service will be visible on localhost port 8080.


## Create a user

Using the user interface:
```
http://localhost:8080/ui/newuser
```

or curl:
```
curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/users?username=new-user

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/channels -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"A channel\"}"
```

Note the returned channel id. You will use it in the next request.


## Create a feed subscription
