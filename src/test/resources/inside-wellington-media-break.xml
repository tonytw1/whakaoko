<p>It seems that Wellington City Council is failing to do its job. It&#8217;s managed to isolate itself from the residents, which has effectively broken democracy in the city, and there is no hope for any meaningful engagement after the Shelly Bay decision showed that not only do Councillors not listen, even if they did, the trust is so irreparably damaged now that it would take decades to restore it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tauranga&#8217;s 151,300 residents are without a leader and facing a fiscal hole of $2 billion after a turbulent year marked by bitter infighting among councillors. &#8220;I think from the outside looking in you could argue the case that the race for the mayoralty never ended,&#8221; says Waikato Times reporter Matt Shand.&#8221; &#8211;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/programmes/the-detail/story/2018775186/giving-up-on-tauranga" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giving up on Tauranga</a></p>



<p>Sound familiar? Tauranga is in some serious trouble with leadership of the Council now &#8220;in the hands of the Minister for Local Government.&#8221; In this case, the Mayor has outright resigned.</p>



<p>&#8220;Battle over leadership&#8221;, &#8220;quite combative&#8221;, &#8220;muckraking&#8221;, &#8220;leaking&#8221;, &#8220;petty and nasty personal messages&#8221;, &#8220;childish comments&#8221;, and &#8220;It really showed, I think as well, as the childish nature of the way some of these councillors were behaving; it definitely showed that there was a massive fracturing between the two groups of councillors.&#8221;</p>



<p>We all know that you can draw a direct correlation between this type of behaviour being displayed in Tauranga and the kind of behaviour we see in Wellington. I don&#8217;t need to link to the articles that date back&nbsp;<em>years</em>&nbsp;evidencing it. Interesting isn&#8217;t it that the dysfunctional behaviour has been around for many years, not just this term. What does that tell you?</p>



<p>&#8220;The report fails to identify the culture of one-upmanship within a group of councillors who constantly aim to score points against me and seek publicity for criticism against me.</p>



<p>&#8220;They enjoy waiting for any pause or mishap as they position to pounce. They gesture and roll their eyes at each other making effort to belittle me and undermine my abilities. In this regard, I believe that the battle for the mayoralty didn&#8217;t end at the last election.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The simple truth is that you can&#8217;t lead people who refuse to be lead,&#8221; Shadbolt says. &#8211;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/local-government/123517903/the-findings-the-fallout-the-future--how-a-damning-invercargill-city-council-review-played-out" rel="noreferrer noopener">The findings, the fallout, the future &#8211; how a damning Invercargill City Council review played out</a></p>



<p>Still, sounding familiar? I&#8217;m not going to quote that article further; however, I strongly encourage you to read it and see the incredible similarities between Invercargill and Wellington.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not just these three Councils; it is happening everywhere; it&#8217;s just how much it&#8217;s happening. Wellington seems to be disproportionately affected by many of the symptoms that we see above and the symptoms that Productivity New Zealand identified in a report titled&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.productivity.govt.nz/assets/Documents/d0b2849e4d/Local_Government-Insights-Report-2020_midres.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Local Government Insights.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>Let me summarise their core findings for you in terms of problems; again, I encourage you to read the report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Lack of affordable housing.</p>



<p>&#8211; Environmental degradation.</p>



<p>&#8211; Risks to human health.</p>



<p>&#8211; Poor relationship between local and central government.</p>



<p>&#8211; Varied and often low capability.</p>



<p>&#8211; A democratic deficit at the local level.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s WCC through and through.</p>



<p>There is a lack of affordable housing, emphasis on&nbsp;<em>affordable</em>, Shelly Bay will never provide&nbsp;<em>affordable</em>&nbsp;housing, it will become an enclave for the very rich. And this trickle-down idea of housing is just dumb.</p>



<p>Despite a climate emergency declaration, environmental degradation continues apace in Wellington and meeting promised targets will not happen.</p>



<p>With water erupting out of the ground and sewage pouring through residential streets and polluting the harbour, I think we can safely say that the risks to human health in Wellington are increasing.</p>



<p>Varied and low capability is interesting. This speaks to the skill ability of not only Council but Councillors and their ability to discharge their duties. This is perhaps one of the most significant reasons we should appoint commissioners, because, with some exceptions, Councillors don&#8217;t have the skills they need to discharge their responsibilities for individual portfolios. Worse, the Council proper is failing specific key measures, which suggests they don&#8217;t have the necessary skilled people.</p>



<p>A democratic deficit at a local level. I.e. Engagement between the residents and Council is stuffed. We can all agree that is the case. Shelly Bay was the nail in the coffin for that and the rise of new community groups along with residents firmly turning their back on Council should be a grave concern.</p>



<p>I could go on. But I don&#8217;t need to do I Wellington? Council is broken, badly, and in all kinds of trouble.</p>



<p>On that basis, as a minimum, there should be an independent review, open to the public, and transparent, on the Council itself. I suspect that would lead the way to commissioners when the truth came out about the real issues underlying issues displaying in the real world.</p>



<p>Shelly bay was a vote of no confidence by the Council in what residents wanted. The public is now voting no confidence in the Council across every digital platform in existence. No amount of smiley selfies on social media by Councillors is going to restore that faith.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that lack of democracy comes at the point when the Council and city most need it. Because people are (presumably) going to be asked to fork out significant amounts of money from their wallets to fix essential services. Council must engage on those plans, yet, engagement has been stabbed to death.</p>



<p>That may be the most significant case for commissioners. If the Council refuses to participate in engagement and democracy, then, it would be better to replace them with people who are skilled in specific portfolio areas, such as water.</p>



<p>So, commissioners? Not yet, but we&#8217;re nearly there. Independent audit? Definitely. Right now, and also a specific one that looks at Shelly Bay, because the Council may think by selling the land they are out of the debate, but they are not, and there are some very, very serious questions that need answering around how they arrived where they did.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t talk to me about amalgamation. All we&#8217;d do is recreate this problem on a regional scale. We need to reset the Council first. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk about that tomorrow, and the two possible paths the Council could take right now. </p>

<p>As some of you know, I&#8217;ve started working back in the city, at least three days a week, after some months of relative isolation on the farm. The last couple of weeks have been an eye-opener for me, it is hard to fathom just how much the city has changed since COVID and the future looks dire.</p>



<p>The city itself feels emptier than usual. Those days where Lambton Quay bustled at lunchtime seem to be over, and with so many people working these days remotely, it&#8217;s no wonder. Wellington has been under sustained attack in the media lately, with every second day seeing another article about how terrible it is. Well, I&#8217;m about to add to the list I guess.<br>The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes have well and truly been revealed, and the ugly truth is that the city is going through growing pains that may kill it. That&#8217;s right, growing pains. The move from spirited, wasteful, teenager to adult is proving a bridge too far.</p>



<p>Teenagers, interested in toys, vanities, and frivolous spending, while so concerned with their image must soon grow up. Adults must pay the bills, insurance, put money aside for maintenance, get a job to pay for it, and deal with harsh realities.<br>At the head of the city is the Council, who is not growing up, but seemingly regressing into childhood. The lack of maturity is astounding. Where they should be leading, they are into playground politics, schoolyard squabbling, and bad behaviour. The naivety is extreme, and most of them couldn&#8217;t govern their way out of a paper bag.</p>



<p>No Council has done this amount of damage to the relationship between the residents and local government ever. Not. Ever. I mean, there have been some abysmal decisions in the past decade that have damaged the trust between resident and Council, but, the Shelly Bay decision was a sledgehammer through whatever goodwill was left between the city and the Council.<br>I spent Saturday night in Wellington, we went to a birthday party that was hosted at Double Vision Brewery in Miramar. I have a very diverse range of friends, one of the topics of conversation was Shelly Bay and the Council. As well as those discussions, since the Council decided to sell their land at Shelly Bay, I&#8217;ve watched the feedback across social media and other communication channels.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m yet to find anyone other than the Councillors who voted to sell the land in agreement with the decision. At best, people are incredulous, and at worst, they are furious. The word &#8220;traitors&#8221; has been used multiple times across various channels.</p>



<p>The view is that the Council has betrayed, another commonly used word, their community, not so much because of the sale but because people were very opposed to it in that form. Worse, some Councillors who campaigned on NOT selling Shelly Bay then flip-flopped and voted to do just that. Teri O&#8217;Neill in Eastern Suburbs is going to be a one-term Councillor based on feedback out that way, as well a couple of others around the city.<br>The other piece of feedback is that the Councillors who voted for the sale and used the reasoning that it was helping Maori were either morons or deliberately playing politics. One person said to me &#8220;How exactly does selling city land to a rich developer help Maori?&#8221; Indeed.</p>



<p>Then, of course, are the issues of legality surrounding the land, still unresolved. Numerous issues raised about the ongoing costs of infrastructure, you can&#8217;t tell me that it will be capped at $10m, this Council has an almost perfect record of blowing out every project they put their hand too. The Evan&#8217;s bay cycleway has cost $20+m so far, so imagine what sewage, water, gas, and roading changes are going to cost to service Shelly Bay.</p>



<p>Then there is the simple economics of the land price, no doubt sold for well under its actual value.<br>I can&#8217;t get my head around whether the Council is just plain stupid, or there is some broader game in play. But as my great-grandfather was fond of saying, &#8220;Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.&#8221; Hanlon&#8217;s razor in action perhaps.</p>



<p>I went and looked up the definition of &#8220;stupid&#8221; which is, &#8220;having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense.&#8221; Isn&#8217;t that interesting? Because that term certainly applies to some Councillors and indeed some decisions of late.<br>Teenagers often lack common sense and indeed while being credited with intelligence, sometimes seem to fail to apply it. As a friend of mine said to his child at one point &#8220;For someone so smart, you sure can be stupid.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not looking good for Wellington. Public transport is collapsing slowly (not strictly the Council&#8217;s fault but they could act on it), WellingtonNZ (WREDA) is failing to bring back life to the city (not that they ever really did much other than suck up $20m plus a year), water pipes are stuffed, sewage pipes are stuffed, harbours and coast are frequently polluted, LGWM is going nowhere, the climate emergency amounted to nothing, rates are about to go through the ceiling, traffic is awful, the inner city after dark is a war zone, house prices are off the scale, the CBD is slowly dying, people are starting to leave, and the entire town is now considered worse than Auckland, something I would never have thought could happen.</p>



<p>In the midst of this, the Council, who are meant to be leading, have broken themselves into uneasy factions of which some are attempting to undermine the mayor and the more &#8220;conservative&#8221; Councillors. They&#8217;ve forgotten the face of their father, to coin an old phrase. The city means nothing to them, they are consumed with petty politics driven by a naïve allegiance to broader party politics.</p>



<p>Frankly, they need to grow up or resign. Because running Council right now means that all vanity projects, including the White Elephant Convention Centre, need to be pushed down the years instead of the critical, adult, stuff. And, they need to agree to work together on that plan rather than behaving like a pack of entitled, know it all, children.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though, I don&#8217;t think they can shift out of the mode they&#8217;ve got themselves into, so, they really do need to be removed in my opinion. Shelly Bay was an interesting test, which has shown the whole city that the Council may not actually be up to the job.</p>



<p>Next; is it time for Commissioners to be brought in?</p>

<p>It has been a while since I last wrote to you dear reader. I make no excuse for the lengthy pause between posts, sometimes, as a writer, inspiration takes a holiday of its own accord, and you are left staring at a blank page. But enough of that, let me update you on the grand adventure.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Let’s talk about Wairarapa grass, apparently legendary across New Zealand for its near-magical growth capability, I now know why. Over spring, it grows somewhere between six to ten centimetres,&nbsp;<em>each week</em>.</p>



<p>Worse, with horses that are not used to the local grass, there is a genuine risk of them getting ill from overeating the new growth. Figuratively, it is Mc Donald’s for horses. They become “grass effected,” which is easiest to compare to a child who’s eaten too much sugar.</p>



<p>This means that Karene must relentlessly top the paddocks to keep the grass under control, which means the horses are annoyed because she is taking away their special treat, as they see it at least. They stare dolefully into two large paddocks that are being grown out for hay, something that we will need over late summer months and winter as well.</p>



<p>The menagerie continues to grow.</p>



<p>A new horse has joined the herd, Fizz, and ex-thoroughbred he stands 17 hands high, making him a very large animal indeed. Despite his size, he’s incredibly cruisy, and he ambles along at a plodding pace.</p>



<p>A short-haired german pointer named Freya has joined the pack. She has a gentle nature with an incredible nose and a penchant for just not doing whatever it is that she does not want to do. Being a hunting dog, it is taking quite some time to train her not to catch and hold the chickens, which don’t appreciate the experience.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Speaking of chickens, we’ve considerably increased the flock much to the disgust of the original older ladies who have been protesting the new arrivals. The originals now refuse to lay in the coop and have decided that the BBQ on the deck or top of the washing machine is the new location. For the first few days, they got revenge by angrily squawking outside the bedroom window at 5 am.</p>



<p>Across the farm, the fruit trees are filling rapidly, and everything is growing madly. The grand chilli experiment is underway, but so far, I am underwhelmed with the growth of them. It may be because we have had a couple of cold spells, however, so far, they have stubbornly resisted growing much more than about six inches.</p>



<p>While Wellington is now in the season that is otherwise known as “Sh!tsville”, with unending wind and grey days, the Wairarapa has been up to ten degrees warmer and sunny. The weather here is weird after living in Wellington. When the wind comes, it arrives with a bang, knocks everything over, and then generally disappears off a couple of hours later to wreak havoc somewhere else.</p>



<p><em>Everyone</em>&nbsp;watches the weather. When the sun is just right, the wind is up; then the massive contracting gangs kick into action to make hay. Tractors clog the roads along with combine harvesters and trucks if it is turned to silage. Contractors will work through the night to catch the right conditions before the next rain.</p>



<p>The valley surprised itself recently by electing Kieran McNulty one the seat for Labour in that distant memory, the general election. After the anti-farm rhetoric and anti-Labour rhetoric in the run-up to the election, I had Labour as a loser here. Not so, he romped in.</p>



<p>Which is quite funny, because a lot of die-hard conservative voters flipped to Labour, so the grumbling in the pub is a lot quieter than usual.</p>



<p>My theory is that conservatives hate two things: uncertainty and the Greens. Given National’s rather shambolic run at the election, they were hardly seen as a certainty, whereas Labour is a known quantity. Then, they hate the Greens, so, that only leaves Labour.</p>



<p>Karene and I were sitting at the Gladstone Inn on Sunday afternoon recently, enjoying a beer and a long rambling chat with Ken, who is born and bred, farming stock, and a diesel mechanic, when the following contraption rolled into the carpark and no less than seven middle-aged men, who should know better, rolled drunkenly out of the van and into the pub.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1139" data-permalink="https://inside-wellington.org/fb_img_1606868252170/" data-orig-file="https://insidewellington.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fb_img_1606868252170.jpg" data-orig-size="720,540" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="fb_img_1606868252170" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://insidewellington.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fb_img_1606868252170.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://insidewellington.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fb_img_1606868252170.jpg?w=720" src="https://insidewellington.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fb_img_1606868252170.jpg?w=720" alt="" class="wp-image-1139" srcset="https://insidewellington.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fb_img_1606868252170.jpg 720w, https://insidewellington.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fb_img_1606868252170.jpg?w=150 150w, https://insidewellington.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fb_img_1606868252170.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>I swear, sometimes living in this valley is like a leap back into the 1970s, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I’d highly recommend the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://gladstoneinn.co.nz/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gladstone Inn</a>; it’s probably one of the last pubs in the area of that age that is in good condition still. Sunday afternoons are usually quieter with more locals, as most of the Wellingtonians lunch there, and then bravely drive back over the Remutakas into the windy grey.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>After three months of solely working on the farm, I have started a new contract based back in Wellington. Thankfully, the organisation encourages working from home, so I do not have to be in every day. One of the things that Wairarapa needs to sort out smartly is the trains in and out of the city.</p>



<p>Services are generally unreliable, replaced by buses, late, and appear to have gone downhill in quality since I last used them. So, I drive. Because, unlike trains, I need to be reliable. If I leave at about 530 am, then I am in the office by about 7 am, going again around mid-afternoon. It’s about an hour and fifteen minutes at those times of the day. If I leave it any later, it’s a two-hour journey.</p>



<p>Wairarapa seems in good heart heading toward Christmas. Shops are bustling, and the towns are packed over the weekends. Unlike Wellington, there are many events regularly and the locals support them well.</p>



<p>Now, I may have disappointed you, dear readers, because I have not talked about Wellington, nor Shelly Bay. Rest assured, it’s coming. It’s taken me a fortnight to calm down and think it through, so you’ll be seeing something shortly.</p>

<p>Spring has arrived in the Wairarapa with grass growing (it never really stopped over what was an warmer than usual winter) and everything starting to flower. Days are longer, warmer, drier, and the farm requires more work than ever to prepare for the annual growth spurt before summer.</p>



<p>The region is booming. As an escape hole for weekend Wellingtonians traffic jams become the norm in the towns and local businesses are busy, despite the Level 2 lockdowns. Property continues to be hot with more and more people moving into the area and more and more bare blocks of land on the market.</p>



<p>Those bare blocks, often bought by people outside the region, are a source of concern for the local farmers for two reasons.</p>



<p>First, the time it takes to get a house built often means that previously productive land is not only unused, it also starts to go to wrack and ruin. Even with our paddocks, it requires constant vigilance to make sure that pest plants are not going to spread. Leaving bare block land unmaintained means eventually dealing with a jungle of weeds and long grass.</p>



<p>Second, again because the land is left unattended, pests such as rabbits are left to flourish. In some parts of the region, the rabbit population have reached “plague” proportions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The minister responded on August 14 saying that the Department of Conservation had reported an increase in rabbit populations over the past three years.</p><p>“An over-abundance of prey animals such as rabbits does serve to increase the number of predators such as ferrets in the landscape,” Sage said.</p><p>“As we have seen, this can be devasting for ground dwelling birds such as kiwi. I understand local land-owners have noted that rabbit populations around their own properties are in excess of anything they have experienced in the past.”</p><p>Sage said she had been told a working group of landowners, Pukaha staff, HRC, GWRC and DOC was being established.</p><p><a href="https://times-age.co.nz/rabbits-at-plague-levels/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rabbits-at-plague-levels">Rabbits at “plague levels”</a></p></blockquote>



<p>We have certainly seen an uptick in rabbits and ferrets. I watched a ferret merrily making its way down the road during daylight hours recently, bold as brass. We are training the dogs to cleanly and humanely dispatch rabbits; however, the little bounders are very, very quick on their feet.</p>



<p>Indeed, there are more pest signs in the local area, and one can only wonder if this is because the GWRC has abandoned trapping in a reserve block down the road.</p>



<p>With the general election looming, local candidates for Wairarapa are putting their best feet forward, including Celia Wade-Brown emerging from the bush to have a crack at the race. There are far fewer parties contesting this election than 2017.</p>



<p>My pick is that we will see the party vote go to National, then NZ First, then Labour. The Greens certainly will not get a look in, and Labour is not well-liked in the area. Ron Mark, NZ First, is a constant presence around the traps and a new National candidate that looks like a clone of the last National candidate should poll well.</p>



<p>Despite only being an hour’s drive from Wellington’s CBD, the Wairarapa is undeniably rural minded, which makes sense, given the valley’s primary purpose of food production, which supports many local communities clustered around that industry.</p>



<p>People believe that the Labour party is mostly disconnected from the rural life, and that coupled with the Greens, is actively threatening their jobs, while overreaching with new legislation that comes at a high-cost to farmers of all kinds. God help you if you have a farm that contains a water race or backs onto a stream or river. And god help you if you do not, because water, or lack of it, is becoming a significant issue in the area with water schemes being consistently blocked.</p>



<p>I am oversimplifying the landscape; however, you get the picture.</p>



<p>I still regularly read and watch the goings-on in Wellington City proper. It seems to me that it is heading for some dire straits and things may get a lot worse before they start to claw their way back. The Council still seems to be irrevocably broken, at odds with each other, while there appears no strategy to think about how they can live with COVID and grow the city itself.</p>



<p>The Council estimates about the number of people likely to move to Wellington over the next few years are wildly optimistic in my opinion. Certainly, someone needs to run new models that take into account the extreme cost of housing (price and rent), the movement of people from the city to nearby regions (increasing rapidly and more so as new roads are built), the move to working from home as a standard, distribution of government and private jobs to regions to increase accessibility while reducing cost, and the desirability of the CBD Itself falling.</p>



<p>City “leaders”, I use that term very loosely because I don’t see many who fit the word, have bound themselves to the idea that events will save the city, that they can return to the halcyon days of the mid-2010s’, continue to refuse facts around issues with the city, and fail to see that the decline of Wellington started well before COVID and that the pandemic merely is speeding the process up.</p>



<p>I think that while the CBD will suffer a significant decline, there are clear signs of that occurring, suburban areas are much more likely to flourish. Lockdown taught us about the value of our suburbs and what they had to offer. Again, as more people work from home and events continued to be stunted under lockdowns, suburbs are doing better.</p>



<p>Council continues to ignore those suburbs because the primary source of their money comes from the CBD in terms of horrendous pricing for infrastructure and commercial rates. As the CBD dies, that money will continue to reduce, requiring more money being taken from domestic ratepayers who are generally, paying a horrific amount already with double-digit increases on the horizon.</p>



<p>It’s probably time the Council admitted they don’t know what they are doing and started a much broader discussion about what the future of the city should look like, rather than trying to define that by relying on the WCC executive, WREDA, and the Chamber of Commerce, who are all desperately using the early 1990’s playbook as a strategy.</p>



<p>Until that happens, I fear the decline will deepen, at a point when infrastructure, housing, the economy, and public transport are all in crisis.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we have a couple of kilometres of irrigation to paddocks that needs maintaining, to ensure that the bore water we have access to is not wasted as we head into the hotter weeks ahead.</p>

<p>Trouble in paradise with our neighbour trespassing the Greater Wellington City Council from his property, which as I have written about before, contains the Taumata (Gretel) Lagoon. This incredibly special wetland hosts many endangered and rare birds as well as native bush.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Carterton arms dealer and conservationist Neil Hayes has placed a trespass notice on the Greater Wellington Regional Council, who he said had abandoned a major trapping programme on his land.</p><p>Hayes, who was awarded the Queen’s Service Medal for his conservation work breeding endangered Brown Teal, reported that GWRC’s trapping efforts around his property had been stopped completely. He said he now wanted the Council off his property for good.</p><p><a href="https://times-age.co.nz/hayes-hits-back-at-gwrc/"><strong>Hayes hits back at GWRC</strong></a></p></blockquote>



<p>Apparently, in a fit of cost-cutting, the GWRC has decided it will no longer carry out trapping in the reserve. This policy has already had devastating consequences.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The news that trapping had ceased on Hayes’ land, echoed another story, published in April, where GWRC paused almost all predator controls due to covid-19 concerns – this was closely followed by the tragedy at Pukaha in May, where six kiwis were found killed by mustelids [likely ferrets], whose numbers had spiked over the period of lax trapping.</p></blockquote>



<p>Frankly, it is not good enough. Farmers are already under fire across the country for perceived environmental crimes and the government continues with platitudes about investing in wetlands and environmental work. Yet, when it comes down to it, GWRC has made the completely bizarre decision to abandon trapping work it seems.</p>



<p>With many dyed in the wool Green Councillors on the GWRC, you would expect better. You’d also expect the local Carterton Council to protest this, but, as I am fast learning, they are incredibly absent when it comes to local issues, leaving the CEO to write barbed responses to resident complaints and a mayor that occasionally writes in the local newspaper.</p>



<p>A sad lack of spine then by local bodies?</p>



<p>Last time I wrote about the appalling safety issues surrounding State Highway 2 from Featherston to Masterton, that has seen an increasing number of severe accidents and fatalities. Councils’ in the area remained mostly silent, handing off responsibility to the NZTA, who in turn, made some vague statements about not promising much, ever, and brushed it off.</p>



<p>Well, in the last week a rocket appears to have landed with the NZTA suddenly recognising it as an issue.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A roundabout for the Norfolk Rd-State Highway 2 intersection has finally been given the green light by the New Zealand Transport Agency.</p><p>NZTA on Friday confirmed the roundabout was being designed, and also a series of roadside and median barriers would be erected from Waingawa to Clareville.</p><p>Speed limits across the entire region would also be investigated.</p><p>The announcement comes after years of crashes on Wairarapa’s busiest state highway, and countless petitions and calls for change, all lodged in support of a major road safety intervention by NZTA.</p><p><a href="https://times-age.co.nz/action-promised-on-sh2-at-last/">Action promised on SH2 – at last!</a></p></blockquote>



<p>But it appears this is a PR move on the NZTA’s part, who has promised nothing, set no dates, and agreed no actions. It is an empty press release that again, local Councils’ should have been outraged by, but, were muted in their responses.</p>



<p>Here is a tip Mayor Greg, “hope”, is not a strategy.</p>



<p>And it’s urgent, because after that empty news from the NZTA, tragedy struck, again, this week.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Masterton resident Helga Houlahan, an Austrian-born woman in her 80s, has died after being struck by a vehicle outside her home as she was crossing High St [State Highway 2] at about 7.13pm on Sunday night.</p><cite><a href="https://times-age.co.nz/tragedy-on-high-st/">Tragedy on High St</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>At this point, Councils should be on the warpath and the local general election candidates out with pitchforks. But both are missing in action. It is most surprising and seriously concerning when local elected representatives are nowhere to be found.</p>



<p>Speaking of roads, I travelled this week over to Wellington City for a handful of coffee meetings and catch-ups. The city certainly does not seem to have the heartbeat that it did, with noticeably fewer numbers of people in the CBD on what was a rare beautiful day.</p>



<p>WREDA has been under fire, as it should be, for the post COVID response, with more of its usual decidedly average strategy. In an excellent opinion piece that I encourage you to read, Lindsay Shelton at Wellington Scoop provides some analysis and asks pertinent questions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Wellington’s regional economic agency has been spending a lot of its post-lockdown energy promoting restaurants. And more recently highlighting the number of tickets sold for three events. But strangely left out of its promotions are some of the city’s most important and popular cultural activities.</p><cite><a href="http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=129423">What they’re not telling us about what’s on in Wellington</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>As per usual, the Council was nowhere to be found on this and other significant issues, including Shelly Bay, which was the topic of a long-form investigation piece by Nicky Hager this week.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Any time I am asked whether we have corruption in New Zealand, I say we are very lucky. We live in a country where we will never be pulled over by a police officer or taken aside by an immigration officer and expected to give them a bribe. But our luck in living here can make us complacent about the kinds of compromised and non-transparent processes that we do have.</p><p>The classic area where this occurs is local government (e.g. city councils) which has the dangerous combination of not many people watching closely what goes on but decisions worth massive sums of money to contractors, property developers and others.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/newsroom-co-nz/300049356/the-long-sorry-saga-of-shelly-bay">The long, sorry saga of Shelly Bay</a></strong></p></blockquote>



<p>It is a damning indictment on the Wellington City Council, Hager alleges they pandered to the developer by ignoring the no-sale vote, bent the rules to suit, tried to stop community input, and were potentially misinformed.</p>



<p>As I have said before, it is time that the CEO, the management team, politically placed, and politically active senior-staff members in the WCC were removed. This culture appears persistent and the cancer probably so deep now that only a good cleanout can remove it. The Mayor and Councillors themselves seem powerless to make good change for the city, and it looks very much like they have been captured by the machine or rendered ineffective as a result of its Machiavellian ways.</p>



<p>A week where I am left feeling that the city, our region, my community, and neighbourhoods deserve far, far better than what we are receiving from local bodies and associated politicians.</p>



<p>Stay warm.</p>

<p>Low lying mist early in the morning is a constant now, as the winter doldrums peak with just a few days before we start to see the light returning at either end of the day. Our neighbour, an elderly gunsmith with a wicked twinkle in his eye tells us that it has been mild, so far.</p>



<p>I have given up on mowing the lawn and with the first lambs being born and daffodils appearing you could be forgiven for thinking that we’ve just skipped the entire winter season and jumped to a slow start spring. But, like all New Zealand, we know that Fake Spring starts to appear in the next few weeks before the heavy weather and wet returns.</p>



<p>It has been wet here, but quite warm after the days of frosts at the beginning of June. Horse covers have been put back in the stables and the dog complains about the heat from the fire at night rather than lying prone in front of it.</p>



<p>I see that Wellington’s water woes continue, though instead of the water rising through the city streets it is the stuff falling from the skies that is causing slips and issues. I am always baffled as to why the city does not mitigate itself against the weather instead of running Lego competitions and having all-out public fights about cycle lanes.</p>



<p>It seems since I last wrote that nothing much has changed over the hill as it were, with Councillors still devolving into cliques and filling their associated social media feeds with platitudes toward each other. At the same time, the CBD continues to struggle, the unemployed numbers increase significantly, and businesses collapse.</p>



<p>Government project pipelines are still firmly closed with no sign of shovel-ready work appearing anytime soon and the WCC seemingly in the same boat. Promises of work to get people employed have not occurred but no doubt the handful of people working on the Convention Centre are happy to have jobs.</p>



<p>Back on my side of the Carterton District Council is not loved that much at all. A recent survey saw that just 46% of people had confidence in the Council, while only 35% considered they were getting value for money. This has plummeted since the latest Council was installed.</p>



<p>Those are quite shocking figures because even with a high margin of error (I don’t know what the margin was), it’s a substantial proportion of residents that has no confidence in their Council nor believes that their money is being well spent.</p>



<p>You would expect the Chief Executive and Mayor to stand up and have something to say about that. The Mayor was nowhere to be found on the issue, and the CEO had this to say;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Jane Davis, council chief executive, said the authority was “confident it delivers its services in a very cost-effective way” but the survey showed it “could do a lot better at explaining its activities and the costs to ratepayers and residents”.<br>“Addressing its communications about how rates are spent will be a core focus over the next year,” she said.</p><p><a href="https://times-age.co.nz/no-bang-for-buck/">No Bang for Buck</a></p></blockquote>



<p>I wonder if the majority of Council CEO’s have the same playbook. Rather than acknowledging that there is a clear issue that needs to be addressed, they throw it back on the community dismissively with a “you just don’t understand” reply. No doubt, the Council will be inundated with PR companies trying to explain away the poor results rather than taking a long hard look at themselves.</p>



<p>Traffic issues in the valley are also apparent. The stretch of highway from Featherston to Masterton is frankly a death trap, regardless of whether it is in the towns or on the main highway. Crashes are the normal, serious ones as well, and we frequently hear the volunteer siren day and night as well as the emergency helicopter flying overhead.</p>



<p>Just like the WCC the Council’s here seem powerless to enact any real change and almost ambivalent about consultation. They also do not, on the face of it, appear to be putting any real pressure on the NZTA who is responsible for SH2 at the very least.</p>



<p>In response to community concerns this week the South Wairarapa District Council had this to say;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>SWDC’s Euan Sitt, group manager partnerships and operations, said that a district-wide review of road speed limits was coming, but wouldn’t happen until a 12- to 18-month public consultation period – it also wouldn’t include any of the state highways.</p><p>“As mandated by central government, SWDC will be undertaking a district-wide review of road speed limits,” Sitt said.</p><p>“Over the next 12 to 18 months, there will be a community consultation process, followed by implementation of new speed limits where appropriate.”</p><p><a href="https://times-age.co.nz/residents-in-the-danger-zone-fearful/">Residents in the danger zone fearful</a></p></blockquote>



<p>And you thought that the WCC was bad with consultation. Despite a clear danger to residents in the area, the best the Council can promise is a process that could take well over a year and a half. Worse, that will not include SH2, so it’s pointless.</p>



<p>The NZTA were even more dismissive;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Emma Speight, NZTA’s agency director of regional relationships, said that before state highway limits could be changed, the agency would have to perform a speed review.</p><p>“We commence a technical assessment which takes into account crash history, average vehicle speeds, volume of vehicles on the road, and development of surrounding areas.</p><p>“We also complete informal council, partner and community and road user engagement, which is an important step for speed reviews.”</p><p>Speight was able to confirm that a speed review of SH2 was coming, but said the agency was still “finalising the exact timing”.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, all that data Emma talks about in the first sentence is already available. Worse, engagement is “informal”, likely to mean that they do not have to listen to it at all. And despite the increasing accident rates, the NZTA does not even know when they will start looking at it.</p>



<p>Interestingly, I could not find a single MP, Mayor, nor Councillor who even bothered to respond to what is an outrageous dismissal of resident’s concerns. It is then absolutely no surprise that confidence in local Council is incredibly low.</p>



<p>I drove over to Flatpoint Beach on Sunday. It is a west coast beach that you access through the Gladstone area with a road that is not for the faint-hearted with several kilometres of narrow, winding, gravel roads before you arrive.</p>



<p>It is worth the trip, like Tora for those of you who know it, or a mostly undeveloped Riversdale. A small scattering of expensive baches with “KEEP OUT – PRIVATE PROPERTY” signs liberally applied lead you to a wild beach with what promises to be excellent surfing.</p>



<p>As weeks go by, we are starting to explore our backyard and find it quite amazing. The geography, native bush, natural landscapes, and the ability to travel to it all in a short period is impressive. Though, the further you go, the more pine plantations you see, which is a shame given the alternatives and the fact we will need all the fertile land we can get in the future.</p>

<p>All the dinosaurs have been out over the last few days trying to bully public servants and other staff back to working in less than humane conditions in CBD offices because the retail sector is suffering. Never mind the facts, the Finance Minister and some local Councillors have all had a crack, their toothless roars echoing through empty city concrete canyons.</p>



<p>The workers, finally, have seen what is on the other side of that particular hell called hot-desking thanks to Covid and are in absolutely no hurry to head back to their battery farm desks rubbing elbows with cellmates. A noisy purgatory stuffed full of bodies trying to weave their way around pillars desperately trying to find a quiet spot to concentrate and get work done.</p>



<p>It is no wonder that New Zealand’s productivity is so horrific and the attitude of our so-called leaders to drive the sheep back into their pens is disingenuous. It is up there with the banal politicking of sacrificing contract staff for point scoring and encouraging the entire country to “Love Local” when tenders for large pieces of technology and construction work are still be given to international companies.</p>



<p>Why the panic on the part of the politicians? It is a general election year, and the Wellington CBD is dead. Not only is it gone, the infrastructure is in a ruinous state, and the Council seems able to underwrite the greatest polluter in the city to the tune of more than twenty-five million dollars but can’t invest in simple cycleways. Things are not looking at all well managed.</p>



<p>Working from home is misrepresented by the power freaks, dinosaurs, and task managers. The politicians are often in the thrall of such progressive institutes as the Chamber of Commerce and Hospitality Industry, not to mention the property developers. All three can see their fortunes wavering.</p>



<p>And it is not like they did not see it coming. The advice was given, formally, and informally, during Lockdown on the ramifications for the CBD once the level was reduced. That advice was ignored time and again and months were lost that could have been used for strategic planning, thinking of a new way of seeing the city, being innovative, and listening to the community.</p>



<p>Here are the facts about working from home. We now know that large corporations are planning to downsize their rental footprint, in some cases by 100% if not at least 60%, in what was already a hyper-expensive market.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf">results of a significant work from home experiment</a> were published by the Oxford University Press and subsequently The Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2014 that examined exactly what the effects of having staff work from their homes was.</p>



<p>The results of that were astounding, and, given that our technology today is significantly more robust and advanced than five years ago, it could be postulated in today’s world we would see even more significant benefits.</p>



<p>Here is what the experiment found:</p>



<ul><li>Performance of home workers increased by 13%.</li><li>Attrition fell by 50%.</li><li>Productivity increased between 20% and 30%.</li><li>The company reduced rental costs by $2000 per annum per employee.</li><li>Sick leave dropped.</li><li>Mental &amp; Physical health increased.</li><li>Costs to employees dropped.</li></ul>



<p>Who would have thought?</p>



<p>Who would have thought that having the flexibility to work when required, concentrate when needed, not be jammed into poor office space, pay exorbitant transport costs, contribute to the environment by not travelling as much, get back hours of your day from commuting, spend more time with your family, save money on expensive lunch options, have time to think and create wouldn’t pay dividends?</p>



<p>Who could have possibly guessed that following lockdown, which put people into a mandatory work from home situation, that <em>many of us were never going back to the old normal?</em></p>



<p>Everyone except the dinosaurs and political “leaders” who have lost their ability to innovate, to strategise, to see past the 1984 command and control factory floor mentality of yesteryear.</p>



<p>Of course, not everyone wants to WFH. Social isolation is an issue; however, 60% of people are interested in working from home the majority of the time. Plan for a CBD with 50% fewer office workers and you are heading in the right direction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Go back to your office’s peasants, go back to your old life, go back to ninety minutes a day on a crowded bus, if it turns up, or train. Go back to $8 a sandwich, traffic jams, car crashes, poor weather, diesel pollution. Make sure you buy a t-shirt from a retailer once per week and spend every dollar you have to help the economy. Do your bit. Sacrifice yourself.</p>



<p>Can you see how utterly idiotic that sounds?</p>



<p>By the way, leaders, it is going to get worse. Because people have got a taste from working from home and kind, talented, innovative companies are letting them be flexible. Increasingly, there is evidence that many people are not only going to avoid the CBD; they are getting ready to leave the city.</p>



<p>Because living on the coast, living in the country, living in a small community is immensely attractive, and key indicators show a lot of people are getting ready to go. If you want a glaring sign, look at the latest house price increases between Wellington and her regional areas. Wellington is flatlining, Kapiti, the Hutt, Porirua, and the Wairarapa are booming. Interestingly, in those same regional areas, retail is booming.</p>



<p>Companies that provide for flexible working over those that do not will become increasingly attractive to workers. There is already anecdotal evidence that people are looking to move to those arrangements. Research has been unequivocal for the last ten years; flexibility is the highest priority when people are looking for work.</p>



<p>This means the CBD must adapt or it will die.</p>



<p>Right now, our leaders need to face facts and understand their current strategy of bullying people back into the city or relying on events, will not work. Then, they can start to think about what will.</p>

<p>We have been here for a month now. The full moon came up through the pine shelter belt last night, a strange yellow ball casting shadows across the paddocks, an ice ring surrounding it, the promise of cold weather to come.</p>



<p>We have taken possession of two horses since I last wrote to you. Mahi and Strider. Both from Tauranga, stock horses, Mahi is a quarter Clydesdale Gisborne bred paint, we needed something large enough to carry me, he is calm and quiet. Strider is a half quarter horse half paint, with a wicked sense of humour and a rebel attitude, but a terrible weakness for carrots.</p>



<p>Both are taking time to settle in and fatten up. When we purchased them, the drought was in full roar in the Bay of Plenty, and both are a little underweight as a result. The farmer we bought them from was heartbroken; he was selling off a stable of near twenty thanks to the drought.</p>



<p>Horses have always been a part of Karene’s life, and we always intended to add them to the farm. As well as companions, they’ll be put to work and will form part of the long-term plan to start training the next generation of stunt people in New Zealand, an industry that Karene has long been a part of.</p>



<p>Much ado this week I see in Wellington about James Cameron and crew landing back in the capital. Many opinion pieces that were so far off the mark they came across as petty.</p>



<p>Film is a multi-billion-dollar industry for Wellington that can employee up to 4,000 people at a time, not to mention the hundreds of small businesses that supply it. Cameron, also, is a rampant environmentalist who is investing heavily in the Wellington region in kind, acting for our native flora and fauna.</p>



<p>I drove into the city last week, and I have to say it was an intimidating experience that made me appreciate the efforts that groups across Wellington have been pushing for, more green space, more room to move, cleaner air to breathe. Driving off the motorway and into the city the words concrete jungle sprung to mind, traffic was heavy, and the noise was deafening.</p>



<p>I genuinely have moved.</p>



<p>Wairarapa is a true-blue electorate who, as I said last time, thought that Simon Bridges was performing well during the Covid crisis. Not so much love in the local paper for the new leader, Muller, who is not seen to be the new hope of National and painted weak, if not insipid. His messaging is not reaching the rural community at all, and there is no surprise as to why that is.</p>



<p>Celia Wade-Brown has thrown her hat in the ring as the Green Wairarapa candidate. The feedback on this move was often rude, dubious, and the consensus was “good luck with that Wairarapa.”</p>



<p>She will not get in. The reputation follows, the perceptions of her time as mayor, and in a deeply rural community, the Greens are viewed (rightfully) with high suspicion. There is no love lost here in a place that values the land and water far more than any super-city green politician growing organic basil in their CBD apartment window boxes that has never stepped in sheep shit, but probably enjoys a good lamb rack.</p>



<p>A lot of land here is being sold off in blocks, and there are now dozens of large, flat, paddocks with no shelter, no water, and no services being hocked off to people who want to move in this direction. The land is often sold, then left to its own devices, a wicked waste of fertile plains that require constant maintenance. Likely to remain that way for years given you cannot get a builder here for love nor money.</p>



<p>I have started tuning in to the local politics of Council. The Councillors and mayor seem well respected though the Chief Executive not so much. Is not that always the way? After a perceived Council misstep, over an oven no less, a Council flat that went without one for some four months, before being embarrassed into action by the local paper.</p>



<p>The CEO of SWDC wrote a letter to the paper (there is no social media here my friends) that gave a long list of excuses, did not apologise, had a crack at the reporter, made passive-aggressive comments about the “anonymous source”, effectively blamed the tenant, and did not accept any wrongdoing on the part of the Council at all.</p>



<p>Local politics are interesting, and there is definite competitiveness between Featherston, Greytown, and Carterton with the belief that Greytown is the teacher’s pet.</p>



<p>Issues here surround infrastructure (hello Wellington Water), water itself (climate change is drying the valley out while water use is increasing), and things like the safety of State Highway 2, which frankly is a complete deathtrap from Featherston to Masterton. You will read the endless list of crashes and misadventures.</p>



<p>We’ve had some near misses as “townies”, we were ready to take order of several sheep to keep the paddocks under control and provide a source of income when one of our neighbours pointed out the paddocks we wanted them in were inadequately fenced. We came quite close to having a mob of sheep roaming the neighbourhood. He was very gracious about it.</p>



<p>People here are incredibly welcoming and gracious. For example, the local dairy in town has already figured us out, and what we frequently purchase, and made provision to order in what we need. Everyone knows where we live and who our neighbours are, despite us living quite some distance from Carterton.</p>



<p>There are, of course, challenges.</p>



<p>It is cold here in winter, we have had a -6 overnight in the last month, and firewood is a constant source of work, with the house having no other heating source. What we save on power, it is very reasonable; we are putting into wood. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Running even a small farm is a full-time job, you must remember to try and take a day off a week; otherwise, it will consume you. There is, literally, an endless list of work that needs to be undertaken, we’ve both lost our lockdown paunches already and days are long. This is not for the fainthearted.</p>



<p>I am still working remotely for my customers, and one thing that we did not anticipate is the terrible internet speeds out here. It took a month for our telco to hook us up, to ADSL no less, that runs at a rate of just 1Mbs. For your non-technical people, that’s getting back to the 1990s.</p>



<p>We have had to order satellite internet, which comes at a high cost, and some drawbacks, but this is a fact of rural life. We found our location could not connect to some rural broadband services, radio, because between us and the radio tower, a colossal tree exists, some two kilometres’ away on a neighbouring farm.</p>



<p>The adventures continue, we have established a company to allow us to start experimenting with some sustainable products, allow for the training of New Zealand’s next generation of stunt people, and provide a powerful brand. The accountant is quite bemused by the range of ideas, which, as always, don’t fit into a standard box.</p>



<p>The month of June sees the land hibernate, grass growth slows, animals need hard feed to keep weight on, deadfalls must be cleared, maintenance is undertaken. I am praying for a good wind to knock the next lot of pinecones out of the shelterbelt as they make excellent fuel (high BTU’s) for the stove.</p>



<p>It feels precarious and overwhelming sometimes, but when you get to sit in the paddock at the end of a beautiful day, have a beer, and throw the ball for the dog, it feels rather good.</p>



<p><em>Footnote: </em>For the weather enthusiasts among you, we&#8217;ve invested in a mid-range weather station, to get some more accurate forecasts, that sits in the middle of our paddocks. If you wanted to know the current weather in our paddock, then <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/ICARTE6">you can click here and entertain yourself.</a></p>

<p>Three weeks after moving from Strathmore to Taumata Island, outside Carterton, population eighty, I’ve finally come up for air. Lindsay Shelton is calling me his “foreign correspondent”, and in some ways he’s right. Despite only being an hour from Wellington city and still part of the region, it feels a lot further away.</p>



<p>The move under Level 3 was a lot of hard work. You forget how much stuff you accumulate, and it took the movers three days to pack up and move us here. We were meant to have arrived several weeks ago, but our settlement date fell on the first day of Level 4.</p>



<p>We bought eight acres at the end of Waihakeke Road, ten kilometres from either Greytown or Carterton depending on which way you turn when you hit State Highway 2. It’s a large horseshoe-shaped block with flat paddocks, a three-bedroom house, outbuildings, and came with a tractor, which, dear readers, you will be pleased to know I have not managed to drive through a fence yet though I have come close.</p>



<p>Neighbours run an organic dairy farm across the road, cattle on another side, and we have a gunsmith of some renown quite close to us. The bottom paddock to the south border the <a href="https://www.hayes-associates.co.nz/downloads/GRETEL-LAGOONS-5.compressed.pdf">Gretel Lagoons</a>, a massive reserve of 12 hectares including a classic oxbow lagoon.</p>



<p>It includes 200+ mature indigenous kahikatea and 100+ mature totara &#8211; numerous indigenous mature tawa, matai, mairie, kowhai and titoki, together with the innumerable bush birds including the abundance of waterfowl. As a result, the birdlife is prolific here with almost every native you can think of including some rarities such as the New Zealand Falcon and the Bellbird.</p>



<p>We’ve learned quickly that firewood is a must with the farmhouse having no other heating source. The woolshed has been half-filled with more ordered. The kitchen has an original Waterford Wood Stove, originally from Ireland. This is a tricky implement to figure out, and my first attempts at cooking were an unmitigated disaster, but after some attempts, getting better. It also sports a wetback that cuts down on the hot water power bill.</p>



<p>Both my partner and I grew up rural, spending time on farms outside of Sydney in her case and Puketitiri in mine along with back blocks Gisborne, or Tairawhiti. We have worked hard to get back to the land while balancing that need to continue earning money, which, thankfully, we can do remotely for the most part.</p>



<p>Wairarapa seems to have weathered the Covid storm better than the cities and is showing all the signs of bouncing back fast since Level 2 came into effect. Shops are busy, trade has restarted, and the typical traffic jams along SH2 in the townships are back. I see that Wellington remains quiet in the CBD, with many choosing not to return to commuting and office buildings.</p>



<p>While Wellington is spending its time arguing about oversized children’s electric scooters and giving out the key’s of the city to a cat, Carterton has a preoccupation with their town clock, and some significant issues around water supply to the area as climate change radically alters the environment.</p>



<p>Most of the local politics here are documented in the local paper rather than online. There is little social media activity, unlike Wellington city, which mandates a subscription to the paper, which is delivered each morning. I am sure in time that I will start writing about the local Council and general election situation, after all, politics is an addiction and not one that I know how to overcome.</p>



<p>Three weeks in and all the priorities change. Stock must be sourced with sheep to be bought, horses to be found, and paddocks topped off to ensure no issues.</p>



<p>Water must be carefully managed, and while we have access to a bore, each time that water is taken, it is being removed from the environment and can impact not only Gretel Reserve but also surrounding farms.</p>



<p>Due to the proximity of the organic dairy farm, no harsh chemicals or fertilisers can be used, necessitating new ways of thinking about how to keep a farm well supplied. Also, waterways must be kept clear and clean to ensure that flooding risk is reduced.</p>



<p>All quite different from the city life of commuting into the city, sitting in an office, and returning home at the end of the day in that capricious traffic. However, not unfamiliar, it is rather like putting on a well-worn pair of comfortable boots, after some twenty years.</p>



<p>The dog has taken up patrols of the property and as an English Staffordshire, has adopted his genetic heart, that of a “nanny” literally. Cats are prevented from fighting with the chickens, or each other, and the chickens (that free-range) are not allowed on the house deck or into the house itself.</p>



<p>The cats have proved their worth starting to clean out the local pests with great abandon. Mice and rats are being removed, and yesterday they caught a rabbit, out here a creature that will dig holes in your paddocks creating a safety risk for stock and humans, not to mention getting into the vegetable patch.</p>



<p>This is the beginning of an adventure for the both us. We passionately believe that sustainably utilising the land is of the utmost importance. Something that we are planning for.</p>



<p>I am unsure where my writing will head. Politics is in its future, that much is guaranteed, and I think that a view of rural New Zealand is essential. There has been a split created, by politicians, most likely deliberately, between town and country. As someone with a foot in both camps, this makes for interesting subject matter.</p>



<p>So, as your foreign correspondent, as I find time to write in balance with the work that managing a farm entails, you will hear more.</p>

<p>News over the last week that Sue Wells is being bought in to try and help a Council that appears on the face of it to have become tribal, and not in the right way. Chatter also from the former Deputy Mayor, Paul Eagle, that this may signal a move toward installing commissioners in the Council. So, what does that all mean and how likely is it?</p>



<p>TLDR:</p>



<ul><li>In 2012 Kaipara Council had commissioners appointed for some years after major issues were uncovered in Council.</li><li>Many of those issues that saw that intervention are the same for Wellington City Council, in some cases, those issues are worse.</li><li>Issues at Kaipara included poor financials, poor governance, a breakdown in relationship with the community, loss of institutional knowledge through outsourcing of services leading to “consultant capture”, and dysfunction at Council and it’s executive.</li><li>There is a 70% chance, in my opinion, that we will see commissioners appointed in Wellington.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>A note to readers:</em></p><p><em>Dear readers, this is likely to be one of my last long-form pieces on the Wellington City Council as in the next few days, with lockdown reduced to level 3, my partner and I will be moving to the Wairarapa. Rest assured I will be keeping an eye on the hometown and still commuting occasionally for work and commenting on our Council.</em></p><p><em>I will be taking up the position of the Wairarapa Foreign Correspondent for Wellington Scoop, and I am keen to understand how Carterton District Council operates and what issues that community has. I think there are some exciting stories between two different Councils that appear to be chalk and cheese.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>But let’s get back to commissioners and the Wellington City Council.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Rongotai Labour MP and former deputy mayor Paul Eagle said the situation could lead to a government commissioner being brought in to help the Council, noting the facilitator recruited by Foster &#8211; Sue Wells &#8211; had previously shown support for the idea.</p><p><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/121252515/problems-at-wellington-city-council-could-result-in-crown-commissioner-being-brought-in-to-help-says-former-deputy-mayor">Problems at Wellington City Council could result in Crown commissioner being brought in to help, says former deputy mayor</a></p></blockquote>



<p>It is clear, as evidenced since the election last year that the WCC is dysfunctional. Constant sniping, inability to work together, lack of consensus, an organisation that leaks like a sieve and discordant voices within the machinery itself have led to, in my opinion, stasis.</p>



<p>In effect, what I wrote about some months ago, the risk of this Council achieving nothing more than stasis. No progress. It’s a broad statement; some areas do deliver as noted in Council reports.</p>



<p>Sure, we have had Covid drop itself squarely into our laps over this period; however, the Council response to this has been lacklustre with significant opportunities missed while they argue over car parks. I know Councillors, it is not quite that cut and dried; however, that is the general <em>perception</em> that exists in your communities.</p>



<p>I have people now who have never expressed an interest in local politics messaging me and asking what is going on. The damage to the trust between residents and the Council is at an all-time high.</p>



<p>So. Is it time for a commissioner or commissioners?</p>



<p>First, a commissioner can be appointed by the government when they feel that the Council is unable to function, and this is causing detriment to the city.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>258 F Minister may appoint commission </p><p>(My edit for readability)</p><p>The Minister may appoint a Commission to a local authority if the Minister believes, on reasonable grounds, that a significant problem relating to the local authority is imparing, or likely to impair, the good local government of the local authority&#8217;s district or region.</p><p><a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0084/latest/DLM4925975.html">Minister may appoint commission</a></p></blockquote>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"></div></div>



<p>It is worth reading the entirety of the legislation to understand the circumstances in which commissioners can be appointed, their powers (which are extensive), and how governance operates.</p>



<p>In short, the Council can request the Minister appoint a commission, or the Minister can do so if specific criteria are met. So, are criteria being met?</p>



<p>Let us take a case study, that of Kaipara Council when back in 2012 commissioners were appointed and there for several years. So, what happened at Kaipara and what is happening in Wellington?</p>



<p>In Kaipara, what triggered the commission was an issue with debt, that caused a massive uproar when the Council proposed rate increases of over 30%. That, coupled with a dysfunctional Council itself, with many of the hallmarks of WCC, saw commissioners installed.</p>



<p><a href="https://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1208/Kaipara_Review_Team_report.pdf">You can read the full Report here</a>, which was made back in 2012, and you should look for context because I am going to summarise the issues here only. As you read each of these summaries, hold the WCC in the back of your head, and ask yourself, “is this also an issue for Wellington Council?”</p>



<h2>Finances</h2>



<p>Kaipara had massive issues with funding. The causes were long and complicated; however, it was heading toward potential bankruptcy if you read between the lines (my words.)</p>



<p>The WCC has less of an issue with finance; however, when you investigate their outlying years and add in the massive debt likely to be introduced by fixing infrastructure, there is a minor correlation. Add to that the increasing disquiet by residents over spending priorities, and in the future, this could become more of an issue.</p>



<h2>A Failure of Governance</h2>



<p>The review team found that governance at Kaipara had failed.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“At the heart of this failure, there appears to be a poor understanding amongst councillors of what the governance role of elected representatives is.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Feedback from some Wellington Councillors to me and others over the last few months have highlighted this as a potential issue.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It is apparent that the Council’s elected representatives have relied heavily on the advice and direction of the Council’s Chief Executive. The Review Team has been told that the previous Chief Executive was very judicious in what information he presented to the elected representatives and that in many instances they were making decisions based on Report of the Kaipara District Council Review Team 6 inadequate information. However, an elected representative is obliged to ensure they have sufficient information to make informed decisions, and as the employer of the Chief Executive can direct him/her in this regard.”</p></blockquote>



<p>There has long been complaint about the quality and timeliness of the information that has been provided to successive Wellington Councils, at times. Hundreds of pages of documentation sent the day before a meeting to Councillors has been seen in the past. However, the salient point here is; regardless of the information submitted to Councillors, Councillors are still responsible for governing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The Review Team has formed the view that collectively the current Mayor and Councillors have insufficient experience and skills amongst to deal with the significant challenges the Council is facing.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Putting aside representative democracy, whereby we vote people into Council who may not be up to the task of running Council, a quick look across the WCC will tell you that in many cases, our representatives are not always equipped with the right skills to get the job done. This shows in some strange decisions and an overabundance of making decisions based on personal dogma, rather than evidence.</p>



<h2>The Community</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“From the Review Team’s meetings with interest groups and community representatives it concluded that in the Kaipara district there has been a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between the Council and the community it serves. A community member spoke of a ‘festering climate of mistrust in both the governance arm and the management arm of the Kaipara District Council’. People spoke of a lack of transparency in the Council and said that they were not provided with timely or accurate information. The perceived failure of the Mayor, Deputy Mayor and Councillors to front meetings with the community was seen as a serious problem.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Engagement with the Community in Wellington is and has been for some years, a serious issue that no Council has managed to remedy, with some previous Councillors and Executives pushing quietly to reduce the engagement significantly.</p>



<h2>Services</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Like many local authorities of its size, the Kaipara District Council has outsourced almost all of its core functions, the oversight of which is done under a ‘provision of professional services contract’. Practically the whole of the delivery chain for roading, water, storm water and waste water services, solid waste, resource consents and compliance, and district planning have been outsourced. Alan Bickers identifies that this creates a high risk of consultant capture. It is apparent that the Council has lost institutional knowledge and control of intellectual property relating to these activities, and finds itself in a weak position to set policy and undertake planning and asset management.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Identical to Wellington.</p>



<p>Now let’s skip to the recommendations, because if Wellington wants to avoid commissioners being appointed, then these would be a great place to start, again, I take only snippets from the Report.</p>



<h2>Recommendations</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Comprehensive governance training is provided to the Mayor and Councillors who are elected at the end of the commissioners’ appointment, through the Local Government New Zealand ‘Know How’ programme. The uptake of this training should be monitored by the Crown observer.”</p><p>“A comprehensive plan is developed for engagement with the Kaipara community at all levels (commissioners/elected representatives and staff). This should include such things as regular meetings with stakeholders and regular clinics at which ratepayers can discuss issues with the commissioners (if appointed) or Councillors.”</p><p>“Commissioners develop a service delivery policy that addresses the need to retain core functions and intellectual property in-house, the practicality of outsourcing delivery of the function or service, the costs of procuring and/or administering outsourcing, and the appropriate allocation of risks. “</p></blockquote>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Many of the issues that Kaipara Council faced, resulting in the appointment of commissioners, are the same that the Wellington City Council faces, with perhaps the exception of finances.</p>



<p>Also, Wellington Council finds itself fractured and in a low-level tribal war with itself, as evidenced by locally reported accounts and constant noise around “toxic culture.” This indicates that the Council may not be able to resolve the issues themselves, further supporting a move toward commissioners.</p>



<p>The chances of the Council being able to address these issues internally is, in my opinion, exceptionally low, which consequently increases the chances of a commissioner or commissioners being appointed. Right now, I would suggest there is about 70% chance commissioners will be called in or appointed.</p>
