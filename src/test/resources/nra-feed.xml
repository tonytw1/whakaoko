<p>The Draft District Plan, the Bike Path from Newtown to Waitangi Park and Lets Get Wellington Moving &#8211; Mass Rapid Transit are all open consultations, and the staff from WCC will be at the Salvation Army  Hall 4 Normanby St on Saturday 20th November to explain these to you.</p>



<p>Do get along and take all your questions!  Find out how these projects are going to affect you. They all involve big changes to our City, so if you approve or disapprove of what is proposed please let WCC know by making submissions on each of these.  LGWM &#8211; Mass Rapid Transit closes 5pm Friday December 10th and the DDP and Bike Path consultations close at 5pm on Tuesday December 14th.</p>



<p>At the Residents&#8217; Association meeting on Monday 15th November we had a presentation about the proposed Bike Path from Newtown to Waitangi Park. See here for the outline of this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.transportprojects.org.nz/current/newtown-to-city/" target="_blank">Newtown to city  |  Projects &#8211; WCC Transport Projects</a>. There was a written presentation with more detail, the link is below.</p>



<p>And some members of the Association tuned in to a zoom meeting on Tuesday 9th November for a presentation about the Draft District Plan with WCC Planners, including Liam Hodgetts the Chief Planning Officer. This was a good session with good information. The presentation is attached below, and so is a document with written answers to a number of questions. </p>



<p>Unfortunately the session wasn&#8217;t recorded, so you won&#8217;t get the demonstration of how the DDP works as an interactive document.  There is a video about this at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://planningforgrowth.wellington.govt.nz/district-plan-review" target="_blank">https://planningforgrowth.wellington.govt.nz/district-plan-review</a> &#8211; scroll down to &#8216;How to Navigate and Read the DDP&#8217;.  One of the interesting things you can do is enter an address into a search field and find out about all the DDP rules that affect that property. It&#8217;s a bit complicated though so I suggest you go along to one of the events and ask the officers to demonstrate it to you and explain what the rules will mean in practise. </p>

<p>The Newtown Residents&#8217; Association October Meeting was at 7.30pm, 18 October 2021, held at St Thomas’s Community Lounge 200 Riddiford St.</p>



<p>This is a summary of some of the main points &#8211;</p>



<p><strong>Workingmen’s Bowling Club, Owen St &#8211; </strong>Cr Fleur Fitzsimons reported that the Club has given up its lease. WCC&nbsp; now owns the building and they don’t want to demolish it. Council officers are concerned however at the cost of repairs. The future use is not decided. A number of community groups are interested.&nbsp; NRA is very clear that we can’t lose community space in Newtown, and our Councillors agree.</p>



<p><strong>The District Plan, Cycleways and LGWM</strong> are all coming up for community consultation between November 2<sup>nd</sup> and December 14<sup>th</sup>. &nbsp;At the time of this meeting the District Plan was due to be discussed by Wellington City Council’s Planning Committee on 20<sup>th</sup> October, and then released for consultation.</p>



<ul><li>On 1 November at 5.30  there is a webinar introduction to the whole plan. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/our-city-tomorrow-tickets-191370944647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regi</a><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/our-city-tomorrow-tickets-191370944647">ster for the launch event here</a>.</li><li>20 November there is an in-person Roadshow at the Salvation Army Hall 10am – 3pm, with input from the WCC planning team and the engagement team.</li></ul>



<p>(<strong>Update</strong> –the Draft DP was adopted by the Council on 20<sup>th</sup> October after considerable discussion and some proposed amendments.  <a href="https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/meetings/committees/planning-and-environment-committee/2021/10/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See here for the minutes, a useful Q&amp;A document and the link to watch the meeting. In the meantime a new Government directive </a>about intensifying housing was announced, so the Draft DP will need considerable revision.)</p>



<p><strong>Introduction to LIVE WELLington</strong>. At the Association meeting in July we talked about the development of a group to promote density done well. &nbsp;This organisation is now called ‘LiveWellington – a liveable city by design’.&nbsp; Watch this space. The launch is expected to be 4pm November 14<sup>th</sup> at Mt Cook School<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The Government Housing Policy, </strong>with discussion of the <strong>Government Policy Statement on Urban Design </strong>and the <strong>National Policy Statement on Urban Design</strong> (which has the requirements for enabling ‘at least 6 storeys’ in large areas of our suburbs).</p>



<p><strong>A Good News story followup</strong> about a WCC tenant who set up a small garden at her Council flat in Newtown, that was reported in the DomPost .&nbsp; A garden supplies manager in Bulls liked the story and sent her a load of peastraw, compost and other gardening equipment, which she was very happy to receive.</p>



<p><strong>The Newtown Festival</strong> – there is a lot of uncertainty about whether the Festival will go ahead as planned on March 6<sup>th</sup> – or the postponement date of April 3<sup>rd</sup>.&nbsp; The Government announcements have said that Festivals will be able to operate with attendees having vaccine certificates – but it seems impossible to make sure that everyone at a free street Festival has a certificate, because there are a multitude of entrances, people living on site and a supermarket inside the Festival boundary.&nbsp; However the Festival crew are going ahead with planning as if it is going to happen until there is more clarity about what will be happening in March (or April).</p>



<p>The meeting closed at 9.05pm. Next meeting November 15<sup>th</sup>, 7.30pm, same venue.</p>

<p>This meeting was 7.30pm Monday 20th September at the St Thomas&#8217;s / City Mission Community Lounge at 200 Riddiford St (a change from the usual venue at Newtown Hall because of Covid restrictions)</p>



<p><strong>The AGM was followed by the usual monthly meeting business.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-c15ffa27-ebd2-4b29-94af-9270491ff4c8" href="https://newtownresidents.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/agm-minutes-20-september-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full AGM minutes are here.</a></div>



<p></p>



<p><strong>This is a summary of the meeting</strong>:</p>



<p><strong>The Minutes of the 2020 AGM</strong> were taken as read and approved</p>



<p><strong>Matters </strong><b>ari</b><strong><b>sing</b></strong> included the History Project.   Martin Hanley outlined the history of this (long-running) project.<br>It has now been prepared for publication as an online document.</p>



<p><strong>President’s Report</strong>:  This had been circulated, and is available online. Rhona summarised the report, with a month by month account of meeting topics, issues addressed and submissions made.<a href="https://newtownresidents.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/2021-agm-presidents-report-2.pdf">https://newtownresidents.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/2021-agm-presidents-report-2.pdf</a></p>



<p><strong>Treasurer&#8217;s Report</strong>: Michelle Wolland, our Treasurer, couldn&#8217;t be at the meeting.  Sam Somers read the Treasurer’s Report. There was a small operating surplus in the 2020-2021 financial year, and the Association has a healthy financial position. It was noted that we handle funding for Mount Cook Mobilised because they are not an incorporated society (Carol Comber is the link person between Mt Cook Mobilised and the Newtown Residents’ Association Executive).</p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-52f778b9-93d5-4bca-a7aa-24952b311526" href="https://newtownresidents.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/newtown-residents-assn-treasurers-report-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Treasurer&#8217;s Report is available here.</a></div>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Election of Officers</strong>:</p>



<p><strong>President:</strong> Rhona Carson </p>



<p><strong>Secretary:</strong> no nominations: Rhona noted that she had been acting as Secretary as well as President, and would be happy to hear from any member interested in this position.</p>



<p><strong>Treasurer:</strong> Michelle Wolland </p>



<p><strong>Vice Presidents:</strong> Jane Patterson &amp; Martin Hanley </p>



<p><strong>Executive Committee:</strong> Sam Somers , Carol Comber , Peter Frater, Marion Leighton, Steve Cosgrove, James Coyle, Hilary Watson, Penny Sturgess, Adam Awad </p>



<p><strong>The Annual General Meeting was declared closed at 8:32</strong></p>



<p><strong>September Monthly Meeting started at 8:33</strong>. The main topics were:</p>



<p><strong>Wellington City Council Representation Review</strong></p>



<p>Sam Somers circulated and spoke to his written notes on this subject. Sam is doing a personal submission and encouraged others, including the Association, to make submissions. Consultation closes 4 October</p>



<p>There was a general discussion about issues pertaining to Council and Councillors.  In particular it was noted that before wards were introduced Councillors almost always came from the northern areas.</p>



<p><strong>Community Centre Upgrade</strong>: a report from Tom Law (Chair of the Newtown Community and Cultural Centre Trust) </p>



<p>This is going very, very, slowly.&nbsp; Plans are on the<a href="https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/projects/newtown-community-facilities-upgrade">&nbsp;City Council website</a>, and on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newtowncommunity.org.nz/our-town-newtown.html">NCCC website</a>.</p>



<ul><li>The Theatre will be upgraded. An application has been made for Lottery Grants Board Funding, which was supported by the Newtown Residents’ Association and Newtown Festival.&nbsp;</li><li>Escalating building costs have led to a request to Council for more funds.</li><li>Lift and office space upgrades are planned.</li><li>The Community and Cultural Centre is nearing the end of its one-year lease in the current replacement location (2 Green Street).&nbsp; An extension to this is being progressed.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Update on Jared Corston’s role as WCC Community Liaison officer</strong></p>



<ul><li>Jared now has a wider range of responsibilities liaising with Community Centres across the City. However he is still focussing on Newtown issues. As before he asks people to use the WCC fixit app to report issues, but he is happy to be contacted when this doesn’t solve the problems, or if there are other Newtown issues to discuss. He can be contacted at&nbsp;<a>Jared.Corston@wcc.govt.nz</a></li></ul>



<ul><li>CAB is currently occupying Kia Ora Newtown.&nbsp; Jared has a desk at the library and uses community spaces for meeting people.</li><li>Steve asked about what has happened to the Keep NZ Beautiful mural from 15 Constable St?&nbsp; This needs to be followed up.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The new venue</strong></p>



<p>Martin Hanley moved a motion of thanks to Mark and Kirsty from St Thomas’s for the&nbsp;use of the Community Lounge for this meeting, and suggested we also have the October meeting there.&nbsp; This was supported by the meeting.</p>



<p><strong>The meeting closed at 9:05. The next meeting will be on October 18<sup>th</sup>, 7.30 pm, at the&nbsp;St Thomas’s Community Lounge 200 Riddiford St.</strong></p>

<p>At the last meeting of the Association it was agreed that we would make a Submission to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on the development of the Government Policy Statement on Housing and Urban Development (GPS-HUD).</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://haveyoursay.hud.govt.nz/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=yr%20social&amp;utm_content=newnz&amp;utm_campaign=HUD001" target="_blank">See here for more about this policy</a>.  </p>



<p>The submissions are due today, July 30th, and ours has just been submitted.  Our message is that the overall vision and goals of this proposed Government Policy Statement align with values that we strongly agree with, but we ask that the Government makes sure that all the policies that guide housing and urban development support actions that make it possible to realise these goals.  The submission is copied below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Councillors discussed this plan on Thursday 24th June, in a marathon meeting. </p>



<p>Between August and October 2020 there had been a process of consultation following which the Council Officers redrafted the plan, one of the key differences being an increase in the size of the areas in the inner suburbs where the pre-1930s housing would need a consent for demolition. However the Councillors rejected this revised plan and voted to restrict the character precincts to the areas that had been identified in the original Draft Plan. The intention of this is to allow buildings of up to 6 storeys in most parts of Newtown, Mt Cook, Berhampore and other inner suburbs. Here is a l<a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/26d22f28f04146709528714a4c4a2689/?draft=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ink to the full &#8216;final&#8217; draft of the Spatial Plan </a>debated by the Councillors, and  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wellington.govt.nz/news-and-events/news-and-information/our-wellington/2021/06/spatial-plan-update-2" target="_blank">se</a><a href="https://wellington.govt.nz/news-and-events/news-and-information/our-wellington/2021/06/spatial-plan-update-2">e here for a WCC news story about the plan they have adopted</a>. There are also stories on Scoop and other publications; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=137180" target="_blank">see here for an outline of the amendments to the plan proposed by Councillors, and how they voted.</a></p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t the result the Newtown Residents&#8217; Association had hoped for. We have a long standing position that we would like to see larger developments built along the transport corridor and in the suburban centre. However tall buildings in the residential streets, shading the existing 1 or 2 storeys homes,  would be damaging to these properties and to the well being of the people who live there. Our wooden homes are warm and dry if they are maintained well, but they need sun to keep them that way; see below for an explanation of why this is so important in Wellington.</p>



<p>Before the Councillors started their discussion Martin Hanley and Anna Kemble Welch spoke to the meeting, reiterating the Red Design plan for higher density housing in the suburban centre. This plan was developed during the 2020 consultation period and has been discussed with Councillors previously. They also presented the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newtownresidents.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/position-on-the-wcc-spatial-plan.pdf" target="_blank">Newtown Residents&#8217; Association Position Statement </a>( copied in full below) on the WCC Spatial Plan, which had been discussed at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newtown.org.nz/2021/06/28/notes-from-the-meeting-june-2021/" target="_blank">the Association meeting </a>a few days before, and the statement about the need for sunshine &#8211; see the links below. Martin and Anna have lived in Newtown and been Association members since 1981 &#8211; Martin is a past President and current Vice President of the Association. They are also architects and urban designers, practising as Red Design, and have been closely involved with the urban design of Newtown for many decades. Their submission didn&#8217;t get much traction at the meeting, but the Association intends to continue these discussions as the District Plan is formulated.</p>

<p></p>



<p>NEWTOWN RESIDENTS’ ASSOCIATION POSITION ON THE WCC SPATIAL PLAN</p>



<p>The Newtown Residents’ Association meeting on 21st&nbsp;June 2021 discussed the Wellington City Council Spatial Plan and agreed on the following position statement:</p>



<p>The Newtown Residents’ Association would like to be able to support the WCC Spatial Plan prioritising Newtown to be one of the first Wellington suburbs where densification is developed. We agree with Generation Zero and Renters United that many more warm, dry, affordable homes are needed in Wellington. We would like more warm, dry, affordable homes here in Newtown, and we would love to be the suburb where the next generation could afford a home. Our Association has spent over 30 years lobbying Council in favour of intensification within our Newtown suburban centre* where 6 storey apartments can easily fit on underdeveloped commercial and industrial sites and in behind our heritage shopfronts. Intensification here puts our new residents right on the transport corridor, with sheltered verandahs, and close walking distance to all our suburb’s amenities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Design’s** test scheme that demonstrated 6 storey infill housing in this part of our suburb proved that new buildings on only 45% of this part of Newtown can provide 2,000 new homes***. The Association would like the Spatial Plan mapping to enable intense development in the Newtown suburban centre, development that works with the iconic historic buildings and shopfronts. If Newtown’s Spatial Plan intensification mapping was all focused on the suburban centre and the Mansfield St escarpment area used by Red Design, then only 16% of this area would need to be built to 6 storeys for our community to meet the expected NPS UD required growth. Our Association would welcome more homes than required being built in this part of our community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spatial Plan mapping that meant Newtown locals would not need to dispute what might happen next door to their homes or flats is a significant qualifying matter that is the bonus of this approach. If the residential areas outside of the protected heritage and character areas were zoned for in scale up to 3 storey infill&nbsp;(not 6 storey high rise),&nbsp;then Newtown Residents’ Association would then be able to support the Spatial Plan wholeheartedly. Mana Whenua, the Residents’ Association, Generation Zero, Renters United, We Are Newtown, other local groups and members of our community would all be able to collaborate with Council, and focus instead on the District Plan Rules that enable Newtown to take the lead, embrace the Spatial Plan, and to get on with providing additional housing****.&nbsp;</p>



<p>APPROVED MOTION June 2021: If Newtown’s Spatial Plan mapping for 6 storeys was all focused within the suburban centre and Mansfield St escarpment area, as in the concept plan developed by Red Design, and if the residential areas not included in heritage character protection were zoned for in-scale up to 3 storey infill housing, rather than enabling 6 or more storeys, then the Newtown Residents’ Association would wholeheartedly support the WCC Spatial Plan and would support the prioritising of Newtown to be one of the first suburbs where densification is developed. The Association members would also support in-depth community consultation, where a Newtown place- based zoning exercise identifies other areas of our suburb where our community would approve of additional future intensification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>*Here 4 storey buildings can already be built without side yards and daylight set-backs between in-zone neighbours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>**Local Architecture, Urban Design and Social Policy practice embedded within the Newtown Community for the last 40 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Design are experts in in-depth community consultation and the driving force behind the Newtown Festival. [<em>Newtown’s intergenerational multi-cultural celebration of place, performance, creativity, culture and community that every year involves nearly 1000 performers and 450 stalls (run by approx. 1200 stallholders) all convened by 250 volunteers and 180 paid crew and staged in the heart of central Newtown</em>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>***Three times the number of new homes projected to be required in Newtown over the next 30 years. The proposed new apartments in the test design included courtyards and open space, 82% of the apartments had sun and views on at least 2 sides, 63% were 100 sqm. No heritage buildings were harmed in the making of this scheme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>****Red Design know of at least 12 owners currently keen to develop their central Newtown properties, 6 of which already have plans underway. But overly restrictive interpretation of the design guide provisions and heritage rules by WCC officers are currently holding them back from intensifying.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Notes from the Newtown Resident’s Association Meeting, 7.30pm 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;June 2021 at Newtown Hall, 71 Daniell St.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This meeting discussed three issues tabled by members, and then had a lengthy discussion about the recently released version of the Spatial Plan, prior to it being voted on by the Wellington City Councillors later in the week</p>



<p>Jan G. shared her experience as a consumer representative at the Regional Hospital. </p>



<p>Jill F. sought the support of the meeting to ask the council to reduce the speed limits in Newtown. The meeting supported a reduction to 40 km per hour down Constable Street, and to 30 km per hour through the Riddiford St shopping centre and on all the residential side streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve C. updated the meeting on the situation with the Carrara Park community garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has administrator rights to the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/148208265388696/">facebook page for the community gardens</a>&nbsp;, and has updated and re-invigorated this group. He also signalled that Kai Cycle will be extending their subscription waste collection service for compostable material and are arranging for a compost collection bin to be positioned in the Park. There was also discussion of community fruit trees and the maintenance of street trees.</p>



<p>The newly released second version of the Draft Spatial Plan was discussed at length. Anna K-W. presented the Red Design submission to the Council outlining the case for development to largely take place in the Newtown Suburban Centre, on underdeveloped comercial and industrial sites, where there is the potental to provide enough new housing to meet the projected need. We agreed that there was a need for more housing, for unfit housing to be able to be replaced by warm dry homes, and for a proportion of the housing to be designated social housing to produce genuinely affordable rents. The meeting discussed a proposal whereby the Association would support Newtown being prioritised for appropriate growth if the Red Design plan was followed, and developments in the residential streets outside the heritage precincts were a maximum 3 storeys, unless the site was particularly suitable for a higher development. The meeting agreed to support this move, and that the Residents’ Association executive could finalise the wording of the Newtown Position Statement to go to the council having heard suggestions from the floor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next meeting will be on Monday the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of July at 7.30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
