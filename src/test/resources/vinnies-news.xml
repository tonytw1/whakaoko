<h3>Is it kind ? Is it important? Does it help?</h3><p>These important questions are posed by a 91-year-old Holocaust survivor Edith Egar in her best selling memoir “The Choice” which is now available in paperback.</p><p>I first heard this remarkable woman being interviewed by Catherine Ryan on National Radio and was captivated not only by horrors she endured at Auschwitz but how she dealt with her experiences and how she has used those experiences to help others. Her thesis is that “you can’t change what happened, you can’t change what you did or what was done to you. But you can choose how to live now”. Hence the title of her book.</p><p>She counsels;<em> “Instead of blaming others, take responsibility for your own actions and speech. Before you say or do something, ask, Is it kind? Is it important? Does it help?”</em></p><p>If we as Vincentians were to follow this advice in our dealings with others, it may become contagious and in the words of Philip Zimbardo who wrote in the Foreword to Edith’s book that;<em> “We are all “heroes in training” Our training is life, the daily circumstances that invite us to practice the habits of heroism: to commit daily deeds of kindness; to radiate compassion, starting with self-compassion; to bring out the best in others and ourselves; to sustain love, even in the most challenging relationships; to celebrate and exercise the power of our mental freedom”. </em></p><p>He points out that to be a hero requires taking effective action at crucial junctures in our lives, to make an active attempt to address injustice or create positive change in the world. </p><p>These words reflect those of Blessed Frederic Ozanam who encouraged early members of the Society.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>“Yours must be a work of love, of kindness. You must give of your time, your talents, yourselves. The poor person is a unique person of God’s fashioning with unalienable right to respect. You must not be content with tiding the poor over the poverty crisis.” </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>“You must study their condition and injustices which brought about such poverty, with the aim of long term improvement.”</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>That is indeed a challenge for heroes, and it can all start by asking ourselves before we speak or act:</p><h3>Is it Kind? Is it important? Does it help?</h3>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5ca52295b208fc28f5b7359b/1554417220331/1500w/IMG_20181219_164902.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1125"><media:title type="plain">President's Address - April 2019</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Vincentian Remembered</title><category>SVDP Conference Activity</category><dc:creator>Millie Lambess</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 23:45:08 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2019/4/4/vincentian-remebered</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c:5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc:5ca5454f0d929759d09dc8e0</guid><description>Gil Lescher was one of City Conferences longest serving members.

<p><strong>Gil Lescher was one of City Conferences longest serving members. A Vincentian since the 1950’s, we remember Gil and her contribution to her community through her words of reflection before passing in late 2018.</strong></p><blockquote><p>“I originally joined the St Vincent de Paul in the 1950’s, when I was a student. I wanted to get more involved in my parish, in a practical way, and this seemed the best group for me at the time.</p><p>Over many years our conference has been very fortunate to have a member of the clergy as spiritual director at our meetings. We met in our parish hall at St Mary of the Angels.</p><p>Our membership has always been very varied – men and women of many different backgrounds, ages, abilities and interests. Most of us with work and family commitments, but all of us wanting to do something for St Vincent de Paul. We chose times that fitted in with our own particular circumstances – some mostly acted on their own, others sometimes together.</p><p>Our work also varied and was mostly low-key. For example, home visits, hospital and rest home visits, offering support at funerals, maybe responding to a particular request for a visit or for some personal help. Sometimes it was just one visit, often more if wanted.</p><p>I was lucky to have a car, and was able to give lifts to other members so we could work together at times. I remember about three of us, plus my old vacuum cleaner, arriving with great enthusiasm to spring-clean someone’s flat. The results are probably best forgotten and forgiven, but we meant well! We also gave lifts to those with various needs – such as to visit relatives in hospital, go on an outing, get to medical appointments or even so they could avoid difficult circumstances for a while. Sometimes we delivered food to people, and Christmas presents to families.</p><p>I remember times when our conference took a special interest in refugees from some difficult countries, sponsoring, finding accommodation, work (if possible), helping financially and supporting in many different ways.</p><p>I think the challenges the Society faced then and those it faces now are all much the same, and a key word in facing them is flexibility. It is good that we remain sensitive to the needs of those we help as well as the differing circumstances of our members. It is important that we enjoy our work and that those in need enjoy our help.</p><p>Of course we must always remember the spiritual side of our work – the two go together.</p><p>When I think back now on it all, the many wonderful people I have met (including our St Vincent de Paul members), I have no regrets at all. Sometimes it wasn’t easy but it has been all so worthwhile.”</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5ca5454f0d929759d09dc8e0/1554343104873/1500w/IMG_20170709_105218.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1125"><media:title type="plain">Vincentian Remembered</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Newtown Collective</title><category>Community</category><dc:creator>Allison Hess</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 23:41:55 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2019/4/4/newtown-collectove</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c:5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc:5ca52e7053450a06a0eb47ee</guid><description>Newtown is one of Wellington’s most ethnically diverse and creative

Cue the Newtown Collective: a co-op made up of local organisations that tackle community issues and create a better space for people to live.</p><p>Two years ago, Newtown experienced some major changes: the closing down of the WINZ office in Kilbirnie meant the Newtown office was the only facility for Wellington’s eastern and southern suburbs; the South Wellington Mental Health Team moved in; the Salvation Army built a big new facility with a drop-in centre and addictions unit.</p><p>Ray Tuffin, who helped bring the Newtown Collective together, says these shifts brought in big volumes of people on the streets. “People who were unwell, begging became an issue, breaching of the alcohol ban and a growing number of aggressive behaviour incidents were being reported,” he said.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.wellingtoncitymission.org.nz/" target="_blank">City Mission</a>, St Vincent de Paul, <a href="http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz" target="_blank">The Salvation Army</a>, <a href="https://newtown.org.nz/" target="_blank">Newtown Residents Association</a>, <a href="http://www.newtownfestival.org.nz/" target="_blank">Newtown Festival</a>, <a href="https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/projects/kia-ora-newtown" target="_blank">Kia Ora Newtown</a>, <a href="http://www.newtowncommunity.org.nz/" target="_blank">Newtown Community Centre</a> and <a href="http://wn.anglican.org.nz/parishes___churches/wellington_city/st_thomas" target="_blank">St Thomas Church</a> joined forces to hold activities to engage the whole community, in particular those in need, isolated and homeless.</p><p> Since its formation a range of activities and functions have been put on: high teas, choir groups, Christmas picnics and more - all with the mantra of ‘total inclusivity’.</p><p>“<em>The results have been remarkable: begging on the streets reduced dramatically, people from all walks of life connecting on the streets, barriers between the community were broken down, aggressive behaviour was reduced,</em>” Ray says.</p><p>One of the most successful projects has been the Bloom community centre. Artists and musicians have transformed the disused Salvation Army store on Rintoul Street into a thriving wellness centre. A mental health percussion band gathers weekly in the space and a weekly choir group with singers from mental health, special needs and addictions units attending.</p><p>Millie Lambess of St Vincent de Paul’s says all of the organisations involved in the Collective exist to help people one way or another.</p><p> “<em>By working together and pooling our resources and expertise together we are able to make a bigger impact on the people of Newtown through our events and initiatives.</em>”</p><p>The Collective has helped further turn Newtown into a true gem in Wellington – “<em>we find the community in Newtown is very active and open to supporting one another to create a positive place to live.</em>”</p><p>Salvation Army’s corps officer Lachlan Marshall says the strong sense of community helps everyone connect and have a sense of belonging in Newtown.</p><p>He has high hopes for the Collective to continue creating community health and resilience.</p>

The week that I said these goodbyes (and desperately tried to clean up three years worth of mess in my office and on my computer) was fraught with worry and sadness. Worry about whether I was making a good decision and worry about how clients would react to my departure. Sadness because goodbyes are emotionally tough, especially when you are saying multiple over the course of a single day!</p><p>Then there was the Christchurch shootings. I sat glued to my tv that Friday night, and my thoughts went to the Muslim families and individuals that I had come into contact with over the past three years. My heart broke and I felt even more disconnected from the community I said goodbye to. My thoughts have remained with all those that were affected, my heart goes out to you all in your time of sorrow. As-salāmu ʿalaykum السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>To accompany my message of farewell and heartache, I thought I might also reflect on the past three years I spent with Vinnies as their social worker. This was the first role I had as a qualified, registered social worker. I had just moved back to Wellington, it was a gloriously warm summer and I was three months pregnant with my surrogate baby, Thea (unbeknownst to my new colleagues!). My first year in the role was full of better work stories (but if I’m honest, they continued throughout the following years too). From supporting single mums dealing with the struggles of raising children with disabilities, advocating for parents to keep their children in their care, battling with government departments to get clients’ rightfully owed back payments, fighting for people to remain safely and warmly housed, interesting immigration issues, to that one time I may have teetered on the edge of going a step too far for a client, where I found myself climbing the fire escape of a boarding house at 4am on a Sunday to ensure my client wasn’t going to miss a flight to be reunited with her family! It’s been a hell of a ride, and one I may come to miss.</p><p>I hope that the social worker that makes Vinnies their new home will come full of innovation and empathy, and maybe they’ll be able to crack the perfect system for a client choice food bank, while simultaneously questioning the role of food banks in today’s society </p><p>(I know it was a challenge for me!). </p><p>To my Vinnies whānau I miss you so much already, as do I miss the people I helped support, and came to know. I wish you all the very best.</p><p>“How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.” – Winnie The Pooh.</p><p>Noho ora mai.”</p><p><strong>Kim Sheehan</strong> | Registered Social Worker</p>

<p>Solving digital poverty requires identifying the groups most affected, the issues they face, and the areas of life impacted by a lack of digital inclusion. The social work undertaken by Kim Sheehan at SVDP in Newtown is intertwined with issues of digital poverty, particularly the financial barriers to accessing devices. For clients on Work and Income (WINZ) benefits, for example, buying phones and a home internet connection are not the highest priorities. For homeless clients, finding a place to charge phones and access public Wi-Fi connections is even harder.</p><p>A major group affected by digital poverty is rangatahi/youth, where the bring your own device (BYOD) policies in schools disadvantage them from the start. Ray Tuffin, dealing with clients at Paul Eagle’s office in Newtown, made two salient points on this. First, where students are unable to afford their own devices, they may be allowed to complete work on school-owned tablets but are unable to take them home, and hence they fall behind with homework. Second, the apps required by schools add hidden costs on top of purchasing devices, illustrating the number of ways that financial hardships can hinder students’ learning.</p><p>Another major issue, affecting all users, is trust. When rangatahi can’t afford devices, they often use free Wi-Fi at libraries and other public spaces, where their digital connectivity is often unsupervised and unsecure. For older clients, especially those with Kim at SVDP and the City Mission social workers down the road in Newtown, distrust in the Internet, especially with the input of personal details, leads to fewer users and higher levels of isolation. </p><p>Only two of the 34 elderly clients at the City Mission, for example, use mobile phones, an issue caused by both a lack of trust and a lack of skills.</p><p>After access and trust, the skills gap is the third major barrier to digital inclusion and is often tied in with a fourth: motivation. Both Kim and Ray’s work with refugee clients has highlighted this, as the lack of English-language skills prevents the successful navigation of sites such as <a href="https://my.msd.govt.nz/" target="_blank">MyMSD</a> and databases for job seekers. This leads to a lack of motivation to use these sites and therefore fewer benefits gained from having Internet access in the first place.</p><p>The motivation barrier is also a factor in the digital connectivity experiences of many clients with disabilities. Both navigating MyMSD and physically using the devices provided by WINZ can be a challenge, and without better support these clients may stop trying, thus removing the benefits of Internet provision. The 2018 report <a href="https://report.digitaldivides.nz/" target="_blank">Out of the Maze: Building digitally inclusive communities</a>, published by The Workshop, discusses this and other issues in further detail.</p><p>The consequences of digital poverty range from poorer educational results and fewer real-world job and economic opportunities, to social isolation and the loss of benefits resulting from online services, including monetary aid and food parcels. While Immigration New Zealand and WINZ reduce their face-to-face appointments, clients are not sufficiently connected to engage with the digital communication channels. As Maria Millin and the team at City Mission noted, face-to-face time must retain its value, especially when working with Māori and Pasifika clients for whom the oral tradition is vital.</p><p>The somewhat detached nature of digital connectivity affects family dynamics and mental health, and helps to draw a conclusion around digital poverty: that even when physical and financial barriers to access are removed, digital inclusion can still be withheld by a lack of online skills, a lack of motivation to use the most beneficial sites, and an absence of trust and/or security when using the Internet. Many New Zealanders, especially the clients of social workers such as Kim, continue to face digital poverty in all areas of life.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5ca522249b747a34565aabe7/1554339130553/1500w/detail-senior-man-s-hands-working-laptop_78895-877.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="417" height="417"><media:title type="plain">Digital Poverty</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Suffrage in Stitches</title><dc:creator>Caroline O'Reilly</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2019 21:53:50 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2019/4/4/suffrage-in-stitches</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c:5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc:5ca525374e17b645b6e0d44c</guid><description>Suffrage in Stitches is a textile project devised and led by the

They will tell the stories of the ordinary women who signed the petition or women relatives who have influenced the makers. The final work will include the names of 546 women and over 27,000 hand stitched marks, one for each vote cast in 1893, along with multiple surface decoration techniques and a range of recycled materials which have been applied to the white cotton sheets donated by the Inter-Continental Hotel, Wellington.</p><p> The project kicked off at Wellington Museum in September 2018 and has continued at our studio in Kilbirnie and at periodically at the museum. <a href="http://voice-arts.org.nz/" target="_blank">Voice Arts</a> also joined us at the residencies, collecting audio stories from participating individuals which will be played alongside the final work in the museum during August 2019. </p><p> The 546 makers were recruited via workshops, social media, and word of mouth, along with emails to schools, creative spaces, craft groups and guilds, libraries and welfare organisations across the country. As a result the makers come from diverse cultural/ethnic backgrounds and equally diverse ages, generations and skills levels. </p><p>Makers had the opportunity to join a closed Facebook group to share their researched stories, provide support, and share tips and pictures of their final work. A strong community of practice has developed since September with over 514 active members, 519 posts, 3,489 comments, 19,542 likes.</p><p>We’ve collected the makers personal stories of discovery and connections and will be adding these with the women’s biographies, pictures of the panels and other photographic material, to a Suffrage in Stitches blog which will accompany the exhibition. Biographies will also be submitted to <a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/" target="_blank">nzhistory.govt.nz</a>. The project has already had some great finds - NZ history now have a photo of the first woman to sign the petition.</p><p>The work will be exhibited at Wellington Museum, Queens Wharf from the 2nd August – 31st August 2019 and will be accompanied by a range of workshops including some demonstrating the skills used on the panels. Wellington museum will be listing the work on the NZ museum database and we hope other museums will go onto exhibit the panels. We will also work with Wellington Museum to ensure the panels are available in the future for researchers and craft groups to study.</p>

<p>A large family had a broken beam on their steel bed.  A Conference member dismantled the bed, took the frame to a friend, had it rewelded and returned to reassemble the bed with the husband.  We loaned the couple several paving stones to prop up the bed for three days. </p><p><strong>A client was assisted to sell items on Trade Me in order to dispose of ‘too much stuff’ in the house and get some extra cash within the WINZ allowances. The Conference member had skills in Internet use and coached the client to start doing a few online sales.</strong></p><p>On Thursdays, except in school holidays, Conference members transport and host elderly parishioners to the rosary, Mass, lunch and social chatter that is held at St Anthony’s Church Seatoun for about 20 elderly parishioners from the Miramar, Seatoun and Strathmore area.  This wonderful service for our precious elders has been supported for over 40 years in this Church community through the devotion of a small team of parishioners.</p><p><strong>Every two years the communities of St Anthony’s Church and School Seatoun run a successful bazaar to raise funds for specific purposes such as building maintenance or purchasing needed equipment.  The Vinnies van collected a large range of saleable items leftover from the bazaar last month for selling in the Vinnies shops and contributing to the cost of services at the Newtown Welfare Centre.</strong></p><p>In 2018, school uniform items, shoes and activities were purchased for 98 school students from $8,216 donations made through the Conference by compassionate parishioners and other local people for the purpose of assisting students locally from some of the poorest families in the eastern suburbs.  A total of 310 students have been assisted in this way from $24,600 of donations received since the initiative started in 2012 in collaboration with local schools.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p>Interested in joining your local Vinnies Conference?

<p><strong>St. Vincent de Paul Society</strong> Seatoun &amp; Miramar Conference says a big thank you to Holy Trinity Parish parishioners, to pupils, parents and staff of Holy Cross and St Anthony’s schools and St Patrick’s College Young Vinnies, Vinnies Foodbank, New World Miramar and Repco Lyall Bay, and Vinnies members.&nbsp; Your response to our appeal for groceries, treats and presents for our Christmas boxes delivered to those in most need, was overwhelming.&nbsp; Thanks again to New World Miramar who were extremely generous by donating vouchers for a range of groceries, toiletries and produce to place in the boxes.&nbsp; </p><p>On Friday 14 December 2018, the Seatoun and Miramar members and friends of St. Vincent de Paul Society put together boxes and hampers, delivering them to over 60 households for 230 people most in need of this extra help at this time of year. Thank you to the sorters, drivers and their helpers who delivered all these boxes. Each and every person was a cog in the wheel of this act of kindness in the Holy Christmas spirit to our neighbours.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5c181b2c352f53bb5f1e4993/1548125568694/1500w/2-IMG_1650.JPG" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="800" height="600"><media:title type="plain">Christmas Giving in the Eastern Suburbs</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Vincentians Recognised</title><category>SVDP Conference Activity</category><dc:creator>Brendan Quirk</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:42:16 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2018/12/18/vincentians-recognised</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c:5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc:5c181796cd83662317a94f6c</guid><description>Three long serving and beloved Vincentians of the Seatoun &amp; Miramar

<p>Year 10, Wellington College students, were set free for a day to partake in volunteer activities throughout the region. With the support of Volunteer Wellington, Vinnies and the Salvation Army joined forces with 16 students in the first-ever Food Bank relay. </p><p>Students tag-teamed their way through the Wellington CBD and Newtown area, dropping in to local businesses to pick up donations of food. Ending the day with a tour of both welfare offices, the students left with a new understanding and appreciation for what food banks provide to Wellington communities.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5c11aae92b6a286925ad5b14/1544666672585/1500w/IMG_20181121_092153.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1125"><media:title type="plain">Wellington College Food Bank Relay</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Better Off Together - A Pop-Up Success</title><category>Events</category><category>Social Justice</category><category>welfare</category><dc:creator>Oliver Bailey</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 22:54:24 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2018/12/13/better-off-together-a-pop-up-success</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c:5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc:5c11913903ce6462a79af2b0</guid><description>On November 17, in line with Pope Francis’ call to promote the Second World

<p>On November 17, in line with Pope Francis’ call to promote the Second World Day of the Poor, Vinnies chapters in the wider Wellington region held free stores, providing thousands of items of clothes free of charge to those in need. The stores were the largest of the <a href="https://www.wn.catholic.org.nz/" target="_blank">Archdiocese’s</a> efforts, with others including 150 fruitcakes sent to Kaikoura, the Soup Kitchen organising full days of meals paid forward, and <a href="https://www.challenge2000.org.nz/" target="_blank">Challenge2000</a> holding a workshop and reflection.</p><p>For Vinnies, however, the focus on free stores came after the successful event in August, where 14 out of the 15 bales of clothing up for grabs were distributed. This time around, 48 bales were gathered from the retail stock or donated towards the cause, leaving the team in Newtown with an immense task of organising the clothes, games, books and linen, and laying it all out for the shoppers. The key to success here was the huge number of volunteers and assistance from different organisations, which split both the workload and cost of running the day’s events. An estimated 457 volunteer hours were put in, and the list of supporting businesses and groups is too long to name in full. Thanks especially go out to the groups who donated food, which became another key aspect of the day – as key organiser Millie noted, the free lunch gave people more of a reason to stick around and chat with others, solidifying the “Better Off Together” community-based theme for the day.</p><p>Other feedback from volunteers highlighted the gratitude shown towards Vinnies, with many attendees astonished that everything, even the food, was free to those who needed it. The music for the day, led by a local busker, added to the joy-filled nature of the event, and the sheer amount of clothes laid out gave people opportunities to look for items they wouldn’t usually go for when money is limited. All up, around 70% of the clothes (34 bales) were distributed to 902 customers. The food was equally popular, with 360 portions of banana cake, 300 sausages, 216 tacos and 120 portions of nachos consumed, alongside sushi, Christmas cake, and scones.</p><p>The Newtown event was clearly a huge success and was matched by events in other chapters in the Wellington region, including over 300 customers at the Porirua free store and similar success in Wainuiomata and the Hutt Valley. With careful planning led by Millie and over 100 volunteers throughout the week, the free store format is being cemented as a great way to connect the community and distribute stock that otherwise might be thrown out, proving that “Better Off Together” is the way forward for Vinnies in Wellington.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5c11913903ce6462a79af2b0/1544655910038/1500w/IMG_1687.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Better Off Together - A Pop-Up Success</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Nikau Foundation</title><category>Social Justice</category><category>welfare</category><dc:creator>Millie Lambess</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 22:51:17 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2018/12/13/nikau-foundation</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c:5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc:5c11905df950b736c2761bda</guid><description>We are delighted to share that we are successful applicants of a $5000

Kim Sheehan, Vinnies Community Social Worker accesses interpreters to help with communication between many of our welfare clients.</p><p><em>“Being able to access interpreters is invaluable to my work as a community social worker – it enables me to communicate more effectively with clients who struggle with English. The clients that I work with are typically marginalised members of our community, who often have complex issues.

A thorough social work assessment is dependent on this communication.” </em>- Kim Sheehan, Community Social Worker</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5c11905df950b736c2761bda/1544655144433/1500w/Green-Logo-clear-background.png" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1013"><media:title type="plain">Nikau Foundation</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Volunteer Wellington: The Vinnies Powerhouse</title><category>Staff</category><category>Vinnies Re Sew</category><category>Events</category><dc:creator>Millie Lambess</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2018 22:01:40 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2018/12/11/ba1y6oyi3leri6qnkiqoxx80ae3y9a</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c:5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc:5c0ee1c070a6ad3d9bef2c75</guid><description>Article from the Volunteer Wellington, Issue 35 Newsletter.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Article from the Volunteer Wellington, </em><a href="https://volunteerwellington.nz/application/files/4115/4345/8277/EV_news_35_email.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Issue 35 Newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p>Millie Lambess is the Communications and Marketing Manager at St Vincent de Paul (Vinnies). We meet at their Newtown premises. It is a hive of activity: bursting at the seams with projects to support sustainability and social well-being. Next to the room where we meet, a small group are manufacturing alter breads.</p><p>‘<em>They produce 80% of the wafers used in New Zealand. Quite incredible considering how small the kitchen is</em>,’ says Millie. This project has been going for 30 years, providing employment and social connection for a small team with intellectual disabilities, one of whom has been here for twenty years.</p><p>This small team with a huge output epitomizes the kaupapa of Vinnie’s and the impact they have in the community. After our meeting Millie is heading to Auckland to the NZI Sustainable Business Network awards. The Vinnies Re Sew project is a finalist in the ‘Going Circular’ category and going ‘<em>head to head with some huge corporations</em>’ as Millie puts it.</p><p>This is a testament to the innovation, vision and tenacity of Millie and her colleagues. Caroline O’Reilly, the Textile Recycling Coordinator, heads the Re Sew project which has an impressive purpose. It came into play when the team were brainstorming around how to deal with the mountain of donated clothing which arrives at Vinnie’s week after week.</p><p>‘<em>It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume. Waste is the “bread and butter” of opportunity shops. The Re Sew project gives us the opportunity to deal with this in a responsible way. We had an audit with the Sustainability Trust through their “Your sustainable work place” programme.</em>’</p><p>A shift in thinking through this process led to the Re Sew project which is giving value back to waste by re-purposing donated clothing unsuitable for the retail shop. The project fulfills a welfare need as well as an educational purpose in terms of skill building for the volunteers who participate. It can also provide a pathway back to work, reduce social isolation and improve community connections by working in conjunction with other organisations that have opportunity shops. It is an impressive project.</p><p>‘<em>People from all walks of life are engaging in Vinnie’s Re-sew. The challenge is to support these folks whilst finding a balance in terms of creating a product for sale, which Caroline O’Reilly and the Re-Sew team is achieving.</em>’</p><p>Alongside this Vinnies are involved in other projects such as the recent POP UP FREE SHOP on World Day of the Poor, giving people a ‘shopping experience without the cost’. Free food and good company with other members of the community were also on offer on the day. A team from Mercer Ltd helped out with the preparation for this event.</p><p>Vinnies continue to work in collaboration with the Wellington City Council and other NGOs to fulfil their mission to ‘give a hand-up, rather than a hand-out, breaking the cycle of poverty’.</p><p>‘<em>A recent operational change with our food parcels and with our Xmas gift shop has been giving people choice over what they receive from us rather than us assuming this</em>.’A conscious drive towards a sense of agency for people in need. </p><p>Millie hoists her bag over her shoulder and heads out the door to the awards event in Auckland. Regardless of the outcome, St Vincent de Paul are already winners.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, an old boardroom inside <a href="https://www.museumswellington.org.nz/wellington-museum/" target="_blank">Wellington Museum</a> has been transformed into a fabric workshop.</p><p>Wellington sewing initiative Vinnies Re Sew embarked on a&nbsp;<em>Suffrage in Stitches</em>&nbsp;project to recreate the 1893 suffrage petition in kind.</p><p>The organisation is asking individuals and groups to pick up needle and thread to stitch 546 different panels, representing all&nbsp; the pages of the suffrage petition. Each panel will be stitched together to create a 274 metre long textile piece, to be displayed inside the museum early next year.</p><p>Vinnies Re Sew textile recycling coordinator Caroline O'Reilly with some of the completed panels for the Suffrage in Stitches project being run in Wellington Museum.</p><p>The panels are inspired by women – whether that's women that signed the petition 125 years ago, or someone within the family that was a role model.</p><p>Re Sew textile recycling coordinator Caroline O'Reilly has been organising the workshops, as well as making her own panel, inspired by her mother, Mary O'Reilly.</p><p>O'Reilly created her own panel with green thread in honour of her mother, Mary O'Reilly.</p><p>She also wanted to chart the journeys of the women on the path to gather signatures, so she added meandering green thread to her piece of fabric.</p><p>"The petition went around the country, winding up roads, through valleys. So all these loose threads represent all the roads they travelled on."</p><p>Throughout September&nbsp;&nbsp;people had been dropping by Wellington Museum to talk about women who inspired them and pick up a new stitching technique or two.</p><p>"People who haven't even thought they were creative have come up with some great things," O'Reilly said.</p><p>Re Sew volunteer Irihāpeti Te Aho had dropped by the workshop to start on her fifth panel: one honouring the wāhine of Ngāti Kahungunu.</p><p>"Women have got a strong voice in Māoridom that people don't know about," Te Aho said.</p><p>She joined Vinnies Re Sew a few months ago and said she'd found it a great way to help and give back to the community.</p><p>&nbsp; Funded by Saint Vincent de Paul, Vinnies Re Sew&nbsp;works to upskill people with their sewing skills, while redirecting materials from the landfill.</p><p>The call is still out for people to take part in&nbsp;<em>Suffrage in Stitches</em>&nbsp;– the fabric workshops will be back at Wellington Museum in October, December and January for a week each. So far, people from as far as Queenstown and the Coromandel, as well as some people in San Francisco have put their hands up to make a panel.</p><p>The deadline to have a fabric panel in is February 27.</p><p><strong>* For details on&nbsp;<em>Suffrage in Stitches</em>, email resew@vinnieswgtn.org.nz.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/capital-day/107174633/wellington-sewing-initiative-re-sew-remakes-the-suffrage-petition" target="_blank"><strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Stuff</strong></a><strong> Reporter: Eleanor Wenman</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2018/9/24/wellington-sewing-initiative-re-sew-remakes-the-suffrage-petition">Permalink</a><p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5ba8212ee4966bf0ebf22b2b/1537746125904/1500w/Stuff+1.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="349" height="349"><media:title type="plain">Wellington sewing initiative Re Sew remakes the suffrage petition</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>A Sustainable Society</title><category>Vinnies Re Sew</category><category>op shops</category><dc:creator>Oliver Bailey</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018 22:32:41 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/latest-news/2018/9/11/a-sustainable-society</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c:5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc:5b96efea8985831ae6fc37c3</guid><description>While the use of recycling in sustainable living is sometimes seen as an

<p>While the use of recycling in sustainable living is sometimes seen as an extra (and often avoided) financial burden, over the last year Vinnies in Wellington has made efforts to prove the opposite, by opting for low-cost methods of waste disposal. This has been achieved with the help of a <a href="https://sustaintrust.org.nz/pages/your-sustainable-workplace" target="_blank">“Your Sustainable Workplace”</a> audit by <a href="https://sustaintrust.org.nz/" target="_blank">Sustainability Trust</a>, a gradual elimination of the use of plastics in op shops, and the successful Re Sew programme operating since November in a space above Vinnies in Kilbirnie. </p><p>Far from a cost-heavy scheme, reducing waste is financially, socially, and environmentally sensible, and the implementation of waste minimisation and well-organised disposal systems can create a longterm culture of recycling. This was part of the reasoning behind the push to improve the waste systems at Vinnies, with Wellington Area Council President, John Kennedy-Good, explaining Vinnies’ desire to show to the community their contribution and commitment to reducing waste and protecting the environment. </p><p>The first major initiative was inviting Sustainability Trust to complete an audit of the waste disposal in the office in late February, assessing systems of waste, in-office practices, and the existence of any waste minimisation culture. In short, the office was given an E, well below the required standard. When broken down, the waste streams were only split into two landfill bins and 360,000 litres of textiles sent to Save Mart, bringing the cost up to $35,350 per year. </p><p>Room for improvement was clearly identified, however, and the office has since brought in separate recycling streams for different materials, as well as reduced the number of landfill bins to one. In order to foster a waste minimisation culture, office bins have been replaced with compostable desk caddies, reducing refuse in general and thus lowering costs. A new audit is due soon, with high hopes that it will have eased the financial burden of waste disposal down to the $19,920 highlighted as a potential in the original report, especially given the level of responsibility that each member of the team has taken in reducing their own waste outputs. </p><p>The second key project in Vinnies’ year of sustainability has been the <a href="https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/vinnies-resew">Re Sew</a> project, headed by Caroline O’Reilly in Kilbirnie. Here, waste textiles from donations, as well as boxes of linen from the Intercontinental Hotel, are repurposed into bags, hats, gloves, and even snoods, as well as a variety of other patterns created to suit the climate and influenced by different cultures, often sent in by email. While roughly 10% of the textiles are too worn or damaged to be used, most of what previously would have been dumped is given new life, thus saving Vinnies some of the money spent on waste disposal. </p><p>Aside from waste reduction, the social benefits have been widespread, with Caroline highlighting the skillsets taught, contacts provided, and confidence built through the programme. Two volunteers with disabilities, for example, have gone on to work with the Altar Bread team in Newtown, gaining the confidence through Re Sew to enter the workforce. The ability of the project to “inspire people, to give them energy”, alongside the recyclable focus of the crafts made there, links well to Vinnies’ wider focus in social welfare. </p><p>Another key message is the fact that sustainability can be cheap, and the right set of skills and confidence can supplant more expensive ‘eco’ options. Re Sew has worked in collaboration with community centres and groups in Strathmore, Island Bay, and Newtown to make fabrics and patterns available to low-income families, and other opportunities have opened up at the Dixon Street Flats and <a href="https://www.museumswellington.org.nz/wellington-museum/" target="_blank">Wellington City Museum</a> to create access for those in the city. “<a href="https://www.vinnies-wellington.org.nz/suffrage-in-stitches">The Suffrage 125</a>” project will similarly benefitted Re Sew volunteers with its mix of historical research and the use of different fabrics and printing methods, building skillsets and knowledge alongside connections and confidence. </p><p>With both the ‘Your Sustainable Workplace’ audit and the Re Sew project, as well as the spread of plastic-free op shops, cultures of recycling and waste minimisation are emerging in the Vinnies workplace. As indicated by John, other Conferences around New Zealand, including Hamilton, Christchurch, and the Bay of Plenty, have shown interest in sustainability projects, particularly Re Sew. This forms part of a larger trend in companies adopting environmentally-friendly waste disposal policies, with Rob McGhee at the Sustainability Trust noting that the presence of a dedicated Green Team in the office greatly aids the process in terms of motivating colleagues to reduce both printing loads and their use of non-recyclable goods. </p><p>Similarly, the recycling of byproducts and waste into new items, exemplified by Re Sew, helps to create a larger culture of awareness around how much waste is actually produced in our society, and how much potential there is for repurposing this. Tote bags made out of old t-shirts are the finest example, reducing textile waste, helping to eliminate single-use plastic bags, and removing the need to buy more expensive, ready-made options. Alongside the vast social benefits of community-based sewing, sustainability is looking to be a longterm part of Vinnies’ future.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a555a504c0dbfb36fda563c/5a67a700652dea33e29ec3cc/5b96efea8985831ae6fc37c3/1536621215383/1500w/33151247_1925604477730125_2457387524343988224_o.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1080" height="1183"><media:title type="plain">A Sustainable Society</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
