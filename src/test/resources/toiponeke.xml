This 3-day Wānanga will be a think-tank, a call to 
action, and a step ‘in process’ towards decolonisation here in Aotearoa.

Many in the arts sector are calling to do things differently in this 
ever-changing and ever-connected world. They want to see transformational 
change in social, economic, and political terms, so bringing together 
artists, writers, Te Tiriti workers, politicians, academics, activists, and 
the general public: to kōrero, workshop, explore and learn together will be 
just one of the steps needed towards building an equitable future in a 
decolonised Aotearoa.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>18 - 20 February 2022</h2><p class="">9am - 5pm<br>Toi Pōneke Arts Centre and Wharewaka Function Centre<br></p>

His specialty in the paranormal field is examining photos and videos of a possibly paranormal nature and attempting to explain them in terms of photographic anomalies and personal interpretation (psychology). He receives many emails of photographic documents and accounts from all over the world. In his experience to date, all anomalistic photographs can be explained by physics, psychology, or a mixture of the two; but he prudently leaves the door partially open to the possibility of a genuine paranormal event or communication having been captured. Context is crucial and it is unwise to claim certainty of causation from an outside viewpoint. If the occurrence is local, James and members of his team sometimes go to investigate; examining the site, interviewing witnesses, and recreating the photograph if possible. They also often attempt to communicate with any spiritual presence that may be present, usually without much success. Despite having had some unexplained and unsettling personal experiences, James remains agnostic about such things.</p><p class="">Strange Occurrences is probably unique in the paranormal investigation world, having been established in the main part as a kind of long term live art project, and the group has remained open to collaborations with artists, documentary filmmakers and such since its inception.</p><p class="">With Dr Jo Davy, James co-authored 'Spooked - Exploring the Paranormal in New Zealand' (Random House, Auckland, 2011).</p><p class=""><strong>Claire Harris <br></strong>Claire graduated from University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts in 2005, majoring in photography, and completed a Master of Fine Arts at Massey University in 2019. As a practising video and performance artist her work has a recurring focus on humour, trauma and longing particularly as expressed through celebrity and fan culture.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589a8c096a4963ad40f38d2f/1631663060926-5RS9UU2JGX4HHLN3S6S2/Untitled+design+%281%29.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1200"><media:title type="plain">Ghosts in the Mind, Ghosts in the Machine</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Wound Whistled Air</title><category>exhibition</category><dc:creator>Erica van Zon</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 23:59:18 +0000</pubDate><link>https://toiponeke.nz/events/2021/04/09/claireharriswoundwhistledair</link><guid isPermaLink="false">589a8c096a4963ad40f38d2f:58a76dddbe6594a08412950b:60c154da95190e381eeafc12</guid><description><![CDATA[Three new video works riffing on weird tales, cinema of unease, and camp

&nbsp;<p class=""><em>Wound Whistled Air </em>takes its title from Roman propagandist Virgil’s poetic description of a punctured lung, the self-inflicted mortal wound of abandoned Queen Dido. For artist Claire Harris this phrase encapsulates the simultaneously visceral and airy unreality of dissociative states. </p><p class="">The exhibition of new video works builds a visual language of rubber gloves, broken glass and stormy nights using in-camera trickery and physical effects to construct looping moments of suspense. With sideways homages to misogynous horror/suspense filmmakers Hitchcock, Argento and De Palma, Harris seeks a mood of discomfort drawing toward panic, or collapsing into laughter at the ridiculous.</p><p class="">Claire Harris’ video and performance art focuses on humour, trauma and longing. The works in <em>Wound Whistled Air</em> have been shaped by her experience of adult-onset/undiagnosed epilepsy leading to reflection on the persistent and futile attempt of modern Western thought to divide embodied experience into categories of mind and body.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>other exhibitions</h3><h3>see other past exhibitions in the <a href="https://toiponeke.nz/gallery-archive" class="pinklink">gallery archive</a>

<p class="">Calligratherapy – a meditative practice combining Chinese Shui-mo painting with brush calligraphy for restoring mental balance and order.</p><p class="">Shui-mo painting is the Chinese word for Black Ink Painting. It is also known in Japan as Sumi-e painting. It was developed in the Song Dynasty(960-1279AD) when calligraphers began to add simplified artwork to their poetry calligraphy work using the same materials-brush, ink and rice paper. Their simple but sometimes bold use of the brush would often capture the spirit of the subject, and would convey a wide range of expression, from dynamic power to elegance and tranquility. Together, it is called “<strong><em>Shui-mo Ink Art</em></strong>”. &nbsp; Its emphasis is placed on the beauty of each individual stroke of the brush. Instead of “painting a&nbsp; painting” or “writing&nbsp; calligraphy” The Chinese say “writing a painting” and “painting a poem”, as a great painting always includes three elements: calligraphy, painting and poem”. Thus, Chinese Shui-mo art It is judged on these elements: “ the calligraphy strokes, the words of the poetry (often with double meanings and subtle puns)and the ability of the painting strokes to capture the spirit (Ch’i) of nature rather than a photographic likeness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">This 10 week’s intermediate programme will introduce you to the basics of Shui-mo Ink Art. It is designed in a way to accommodate both students that are new to Calligratherapy or those who have completed the beginner’s programme.</p><p class="">Shui-mo Ink Art has been practiced&nbsp; for thousands of years for its artistic and healing properties. In the orient it is a meditative practice that encourages the integration of body and mind. As the calligrapher draws/writes, their breathing becomes even, heart beat slows and a sense of focus and clarity develops. It brings about a state of calm awareness and over time the calligrapher refines their temperament through the artistic representation of thought and consciousness</p><p class="">Calligratherapy combines western psychologist Jung’s theory of optimal wellbeing with the philosophy of the ancient art of Chinese calligraphy to promote this state of calm presence in the world. It has been developed specifically for those who have never practiced calligraphy before and are interested in deriving the benefits without having to learn the language or all the characters.</p><p class="">Over a period of 10 structured workshops you will learn:</p><p class="">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The symbolism of the four treasures of the art (brush, ink, paper and stone) and how they contribute to the meditative state</p><p class="">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How to work with the instruments</p><p class="">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Breath work</p><p class="">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How the mind works as a self-regulating system which strives for equilibrium</p><p class="">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clerical Script and Running script</p><p class="">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shui-mo/Sumie basics covering three different themes.&nbsp;</p><p class="">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How to determine which style best represents the personal quality you want to work towards</p><p class="">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How to perfectly complete an ink art in different style that best represents your personal development goal</p><h3><strong>Facilitated by Xin Huang</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>NB: The course runs for 5 weeks, then 1 week break on Sun 12th Sept - no class</strong></p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>then runs for another 5 weeks until 17 October.</strong></p></li></ul><h3><strong>To Book:<br><br>e-mail: </strong>alicehuangxin@gmail.com</h3><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589a8c096a4963ad40f38d2f/1626052146135-DXSGF573M4MO3NTKONMN/Calligratherapy+photo+1.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1124"><media:title type="plain">Calligratherapy - Intermediate course</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>CIRCUIT Critical Forum</title><category>forum</category><dc:creator>Sascha Perfect</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:26:35 +0000</pubDate><link>https://toiponeke.nz/events/2021/08/18/circuit-critical-forum</link><guid isPermaLink="false">589a8c096a4963ad40f38d2f:58a76dddbe6594a08412950b:611cde72865db21ab5efc73a</guid><description><![CDATA[The CIRCUIT Critical Forum is a fortnightly discussion group for Wellington

<p class="">To quilt is to archive. Many museums began collecting domestic quilts, not for the importance to the piecing, stitching and design - but for the variety of the fabrics included in them.

<p class="">Applications for the Auckland Write Room Residency remain open until 16 August.(<a href="https://www.popfilm.co.nz/write-room">https://www.popfilm.co.nz/write-room</a> ).</p><p class="">Write Room is a screenwriter residency and producer training programme offered in Auckland and Wellington. The Wellington programme has been running for 4 years in partnership with Toi Pōneke Art Centre. This year Te Tumu Whakaata Taonga - The New Zealand Film Commission is also supporting the programme, enabling it to extend to Auckland for the first time. Two projects previously identified by Write Room are currently in development with the Commission’s support.</p><p class="">Write Room recognises the challenges for New Zealand screenwriters to create space in their lives to write and find a place to do their work. The programme offers a writer a room to write in for 12 weeks, a stipend and mentor support to enable them to complete a draft of their screenplay. The programme ends with a read-through to present the writer and their work publicly. Alongside the writer residency, the programme offers an emerging producer a chance to shadow the process to upskill in key development areas such as project selection and creative support for writers.</p><p class="">Mentors include some of the country’s finest ‘script heads’ including Rob Sarkies (<em>Out of the Blue, Consent, Scarfies</em>), Briar Grace Smith (<em>Cousins, The Strength of Water</em>) Max Currie (<em>Rūrangi, Everything We Loved),</em> Karin Williams (<em>SIS, Mou Piri: A Rarotongan Love Song, We Live By The River)</em> and Vicky Pope (<em>Savage, Two Little Boys, Gardening with Soul</em>)</p><p class="">The 2021 Wellington resident Will Agnew is a graduate of Victoria University’s Institute of Modern Letters with an MA in Screenwriting. He is also a director, graphic artist and musician, collaborating with local bands on music videos, gig posters, album covers, and live videos.

&nbsp;<p class=""><em>My great-grandmother kept her wedding veil in a preserving jar on the mantelpiece. I've never seen it (or met her) but my grandma told me about it last year and it hasn’t left my mind.</em></p><p class="">In&nbsp;<em>a gentle reminder&nbsp;</em>artist Ruby Joy Eade considers the textile ephemera of&nbsp;her&nbsp;own life, the generations that came before&nbsp;her, and those yet to come. A worn out doll's blanket is reimagined large enough for two, garments worn by generations are fragmented across the pixelated surface of a quilt, a network of stitches melts scraps of fabric together into a soft painting. In honouring, archiving and collaborating with these materials&nbsp;Eade converses with their histories, known and unknown.</p><p class="">Textiles in all their forms - &nbsp;clothing, tea-towels, bedding, bags and upholstery quietly shroud our interactions with the world around us. Whether it be a favourite pair of pants, a gauzy tulle memory or a silky scarf snapped up at an op shop, textiles connect with us in a way that is intimate and tactile.&nbsp; Quilts formed from constellations of these fabrics are record keepers, preserving memories and culture. They are artworks that exist mostly in our homes: made to live with, to sleep with, to spill things on, to smell and to touch.</p><p class="">Ruby Joy Eade is an artist and maker based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara. She works in a range of mediums including print, installation, ceramics and quilts. Her recent work explores the relationship between text and textile, fine art and domestic objects, and the complexities of interpersonal relationships.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>other exhibitions</h3><h3>see other past exhibitions in the <a href="https://toiponeke.nz/gallery-archive" class="pinklink">gallery archive</a>

<p class="">Toi Pōneke Arts Centre is delighted to announce Stevei Houkāmau as the 2021 Toi Pōneke Visual Artist in Residence.</p><p class="">Stevei Houkāmau (<em>Ngāti Porou, Te Whānau ā Apanui, Rangitāne</em>) is a Māori Uku Artist who is based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara.  Stevei’s mahi toi examines the connections and relationships that move across time and space through form and design. Her uku (Māori Ceramic Art) practice is distinctive for its carved surface designs that draw upon Tā Moko and Tātau. Used to amplify the curvature of the vessels, these markings also act as a visual language encoded with knowledge and genealogy. Stevei explores vessel forms as both literal and metaphorical containers and has a unique approach to the incorporation of a variety of Māori artforms including tā moko, whakairo rākau and uku.</p><p class="">The kaupapa for Stevei’s residency project is researching and representing matriarchal lines within her whakapapa.  By acknowledging and celebrating these parts of her whakapapa, she will unwrap narratives that will be retold through uku, projection and soundscape. </p><p class="">On hearing of her residency Stevei says: “I am excited and humbled to be awarded the Toi Pōneke Visual Arts Residency, to be able to work surrounded by some of Wellington’s best creatives is going to be amazing. Being a home studio artist, it is a dream to have space and inspiration in abundance. I can’t wait to show what I can do.”</p><p class="">Recent exhibitions include; <em>NUku, </em>Te Uru, 2021; <em>Mihi Kai Nga Ringa Waihana - Uku </em>- Toi gallery, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, 2021; <em>He Kākano,</em> Pātaka Art+Museum, 2020; <em>He Kokonga Ngākau, </em>Masterworks Gallery, 2020; <em>DE-celerate</em> (Collaboration with Francisco Huichaqueo - Chile), Te Tuhi, 2020. Stevei was also a participating artist in 2019 at <em>Puhoro ō mua, Puhoro ki tua</em> - 9th International Indigenous Artists Gathering and Exhibition, Waikato Museum.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Stevei starts her residency in August and will exhibit at Toi Pōneke gallery in January - February 2022.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589a8c096a4963ad40f38d2f/1624941590583-IXP3NYLRDADOMIINX9EU/image_6483441.JPG?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1506"><media:title type="plain">2021 Visual Artist in Residence Announcement</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Te Mauri o Pōhutu: Live Activation</title><category>performance</category><dc:creator>Sascha Perfect</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 01:24:43 +0000</pubDate><link>https://toiponeke.nz/events/2021/06/04/te-mauri-o-phutu-live-activation</link><guid isPermaLink="false">589a8c096a4963ad40f38d2f:58a76dddbe6594a08412950b:60a315ef64e66350b0f8161f</guid><description><![CDATA[Due to Wellington being at Alert Level 2, the artists have decided to

&nbsp;<p class="">Te mana, te ihi, te wehi, te wana</p><p class=""><em>Te Mauri o Pōhutu</em> is a new series of collaborative installation and time-based artworks by Bianca Hyslop, Rowan Pierce and Tūī Matira Ranapiri Ransfield.</p><p class="">&nbsp;The exhibition responds to the loss of mātauranga Māori due to cultural interruption and assimilation. It is a sensual offering that addresses the fragility of memory, connection to whenua and reclamation of culture from within foreign frameworks.</p><p class="">Bianca’s grandmother Ramari Rangiwhiua Morrison (Ginger) was born in Te Whakarewarewatanga-o-te-ope-tauā-a-Wahiao, Rotorua. Whakarewarewa is situated on a geo-thermal double fault line and is home to Pōhutu; the Southern Hemisphere’s largest active geyser. Ginger now has Alzheimers. Ginger is of a generation who were strongly deterred from passing on the lived experience, language and culture of Te Ao Māori. Therefore, the lineage of her memories and knowledge have been interrupted for her descendants. This experience of cultural interruption is one shared by many here in Aotearoa. The notion of progressing our attitude to cultural co-existence isn’t just important to us in Aotearoa. In our increasingly globalised world, acts of cultural empathy and synergy are essential to all of us.</p><p class="">Together the works are housed in an intimate space that acts as a fragile yet powerful container.  There is a palpable tension in the collision of materiality in the works. Between the industrial/utilitarian structures and the soft hue of the video artwork, the hard and the amorphous, the rigid and the fluid and in the futile attempt of containment. This tension is deliberate. They are the tensions that sit at the intersection of colonial and indigenous culture that we need to face and even lean into in order to discover new ways of progressing.</p><p class="">The space is interrupted approximately every hour and 10 minutes. The interruption will cause the space to shift through sound and light, mimicking the rhythm of Pōhutu herself.</p><p class=""><strong>Public Programme </strong></p><p class="">Through scheduled activations performers Bianca Hyslop and Paige Shand will co-inhabit the gallery space </p><p class="">to perform a live activation through the modality of dance.</p><p class=""><strong>Performances: 2pm Saturday 12, 19 June<br> 26 June cancelled due to Alert Level 2</strong></p><p class=""><em>Te Mauri o Pōhutu</em>&nbsp;will be installed and exhibited at Toi Pōneke Gallery opening the <a href="https://kiamaufestival.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkfvl7u7W8AIVWqqWCh20XQMAEAAYASAAEgLoGPD_BwE">Kia Mau Festival</a> which runs 4 – 19 June 2021.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h3>Reviews</h3><p class=""><a href="https://www.pantograph-punch.com/posts/finding-each-other-in-the-dark">Pantograph Punch</a></p><p class=""><a href="https://michellepotter.org/reviews/te-mauri-o-pohutu-kia-mau-festival?fbclid=IwAR23rsaRWGYKmNbzIMZasPSIEE7jPjNg-koNBSip18SXqAabhUUw7RWpgTE">Michellepotter.org</a></p>

<h3><strong>Folding Patterns Workshop: Dying with Shibori</strong></h3><p class="">In this workshop Bailee will guide participants through the process of creating beautiful patterns on fabric using Shibori folding techniques. Shibori dying originates in Japan, and uses specific folding methods, along with tying, and clamping to create patterned cloth.</p><p class="">No experience is required for this workshop, and participants will come away with samples and up to two finished usable pieces. </p><p class="">Materials are supplied, however if you would like to bring additional textiles with you, you can. We will be using two dye baths, one acid based – suitable for nylon, wool, and silk, and the other natural – suitable for 100% cotton, and linen fabrics.&nbsp; Participants are recommended to wear clothing that they do not mind getting stained as we will be working directly with the dye and this can be messy. </p><p class="">Saturday 22nd May, 10.30am – 1.30pm.
