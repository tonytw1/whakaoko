<p><em><strong>Image Processors</strong><br><strong>Artists in the Medium – A Short History 1968–2020</strong><br></em></p>
<p>Te Pātaka Toi Adam Art Gallery<br>14 September – 7 November 2021</p>
<p>Curated by Christina Barton</p>
<p>Featuring works by Aldo Tambellini, Richard Serra, Dara Birnbaum, Martha Rosler with Paper Tiger TV, Harun Farocki, Lisa Reihana, Megan Dunn, Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch, Wynne Greenwood and K8 Hardy, Josephine Meckseper, Mike Heynes, Arthur Jafa, and Matthew Griffin</p>
<p><em>Image Processors</em>&nbsp;surveys a history of artists’ moving-image works that take the mass media as their target. Working back in time from Australian artist Matthew Griffin’s compilation of 133 short videos,&nbsp;<em>Unchained Malady</em>, 2020 – which irreverently repurposes imagery from online news and social media– the exhibition presents a range of works that likewise appropriate found footage, restage familiar genres or scrutinise the mechanisms of the information and entertainment industries. Shaped by artist and theorist Judith Barry’s insight that ‘It is only by&nbsp;<em>producing</em>&nbsp;images that the subject of mass culture begins to feel some measure of control over the alienation produced by this condition” (1986),&nbsp;<em>Image Processors</em>&nbsp;provides a compelling bridge that links the critical aspirations of an artistic avant-garde to the manipulations and blandishments of quotidian entertainment.</p>
<p>In addition to the artists and estates, who we gratefully acknowledge, for their assistance in bringing this exhibition together we thank: Christopher Swasbrook, Elevation Capital; Mark Williams, Circuit Artist Film and Video Aotearoa New Zealand; Ryan Moore, Fine Arts, Sydney; Emmanuel Lefrant, Light Cone, Paris; Emily Martin and Tom Colley, Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; Karl McCool, Electronic Arts Intermix, New York; Chloe Waddington, Timothy Taylor Gallery, New York; Gavin Brown, Gladstone Gallery, New York; Jane Sutherland; Kara Vander Weg, Gagosian, New York; and Katie Trainor, Circulating Film and Video Library, MoMA, New York.</p>

<p><u>Josephine Meckseper</u> (born 1964, Germany/USA) is known for her explorations of the paradoxes of consumer culture, through sculpture, installation, publications and films. She studied at the Hochschule der Künste, Berlin between 1986 and 1990, and completed an MFA at the California Institute of the Arts in 1992. She describes her experience studying at CalArts in the early 1990s as “formative”, not only for the school’s strongly political and conceptual pedagogy, but also because her studies coincided with the LA riots sparked by the acquittal of police for the savage beating of African American Rodney King (in April 1992). Meckseper’s work has been included in two Whitney Biennials (2006 and 2010); the Sharjah Biennial (2011); the Taipei Biennial (2014); and the National Gallery of Victoria Triennial (2017–18). In 2007 a major retrospective of her work was organised by the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart. Meckseper’s large-scale public project, <em>Manhattan Oil Project</em>, was commissioned by the Art Production Fund and installed in a lot adjacent to Times Square in New York, in 2012. In 2015 her works were featured in <em>Storylines</em>, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; and <em>America Is Hard to See</em>, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. She is represented by Timothy Taylor, London and New York.</p>

<p><u>Harun Farocki</u> (1944 – 2014) is a German filmmaker who was born in 1944 in Czechoslovakia to an Indian father and a German mother. He studied at the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin from 1966 to 1968, where he was politicised by opposition to the Vietnam War and the politics of the Red Army Faction. Based in Germany for most of his career, he is known for his political essay films that re-use imagery and footage from an array of sources, as well as “fly on the wall” cinematography. Directing more than 100 films and staging several multi-screen installations, he analysed the powers of the image and openly confronted subjects such as war, revolutionary uprisings, and capitalist exploitation. He also worked as a critic, editor (<em>Filmkritik </em>magazine, 1974–1984), theorist and curator. From 1993 to 1999, Farocki taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and was a Professor at the Academy of Art, Vienna from 2006 to 2011.</p>
<p>In 2014, to acknowledge his death at the age of 70, Adam Art Gallery screened three of his films in a one-night programme curated by Laura Preston in partnership with Goethe-Institut New Zealand. Since then, Farocki’s contribution has been widely celebrated with retrospectives at The Neuer Berliner Kunstverein (<em>Harun Farocki: Mit anderen Mitteln – By Other Means, </em>2017), Centre Pompidou (<em>Harun Farocki Retrospective</em>, 2017) and The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea (<em>Harun Farocki Retrospective</em>, 2018).</p>

<p><u>Martha Rosler</u> (born 1943, USA) is determinedly political artist who uses photography, video, text, performance and installation to expose and challenge the processes by which meaning is made, enforced, de- and re-constructed. Her work in all its forms is addressed to the powerful systems that control everyday life and perpetuate social and economic inequity. She has also published several books of photographs, text and commentary on public space, ranging from airports and roads to housing, homelessness and gentrification. Her work has been the subject of a major travelling retrospective, <em>Positions in the Life World </em>(1998-2000), shown in Birmingham, Vienna, Lyon/Villeurbanne, Barcelona, Rotterdam and New York, as well as a number of solo exhibitions around the world. A restaging of her exhibitions from the 1970s was held at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2012 (the <em>Meta-Monumental Garage Sale</em>). In 2018 the Jewish Museum in New York presented <em>Martha Rosler: Irrespective</em>, a survey exhibition showcasing her five-decades’ long practice from the 1960s to the present. A collection of Rosler’s writings, <em>Decoys and Disruptions: Selected Writings, 1975–2001</em>, was published by MIT Press in 2004 and she regularly contributes to <em>Artforum</em>, <em>e-flux journal</em> and <em>Texte zur Kunst</em>. Rosler still lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p><u>Paper Tiger Television</u> was founded by Dee Dee Halleck in 1981 in Brooklyn, New York. It is a non-profit video collective dedicated to raising media literacy and challenging corporate control over mainstream media.&nbsp; Still operating today, it continues to produce material for public access media as well as providing a library of tapes addressed to a variety of social justice causes and training for non-professionals to learn the necessary skills of media activism.</p>

<p><u>Richard Serra</u> (born 1938, USA) is best known for his large minimalist sculptures, though he has worked in performance, video art, printmaking and drawing. Considered one of the most significant artists of his generation, his site-specific sculptures for architectural, urban and landscape settings can be found across the globe, including New Zealand (<em>Te Tuhirangi Contour</em>, 1991/2001, located at Gibbs Farm, Auckland). He graduated with a BA in English Literature at the University of California Santa Barbara in 1961, where he also studied art while supporting himself by working in steel mills, which largely influenced his later sculptures. He then completed an MFA at Yale University from 1961 to 1964. He began showing with Leo Castelli in 1968. Serra’s works have been included in biennales, at documenta, and in major solo exhibitions in the USA and Europe.&nbsp; He is a recipient of the J. Paul Getty Medal (2018) and he has also been honoured by Republic of France (2015); Architectural League of New York (2014); Spain (2008); Federal Republic of Germany (2002); and the Venice Biennale (2001). Richard Serra is represented by Gagosian, New York.</p>

<p><u>Aldo Tambellini</u> (1930–2020) was an Italian-American artist and a pioneer of electronic intermedia. His experimental works in television and video art in the early 1960s were coupled with radical political ideas. These led him away from conventional media and contexts, to content that addressed the social, cultural and political upheavals of the era, and forms that synthesised visual art, poetry, music and dance into immersive installations he termed “electromedia”, that were staged in the streets, churches and theatres of New York’s East Village. A distinctive feature of his practice was his exclusive commitment to the colour black, which he argued, in a manifesto written in 1967, was a primal state or condition from which consciousness expands to encompass what he called a “New Reality”. Between 1976 and 1984, Tambellini was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he experimented with his students in alternative forms of documentary, collaborative film-making and live broadcast. Largely forgotten by the art world through the 1990s, Tambellini’s work has enjoyed a revival recently. His work was revisited at the Tate Modern in 2012 (<em>Restaging Black</em>) and included in the 2015 Venice Biennale. In 2017, a retrospective of his work was held at the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. Tambellini died aged 90 in 2020.</p>

<p></p>



<p><em>Image Processors</em>&nbsp;surveys a history of artists’ moving-image works that take the mass media as their target. Several of the works selected for the exhibition hold key places in the history of video art, yet they have never been brought together in Aotearoa New Zealand previously.<br><br>Working back in time from Australian artist Matthew Griffin’s compilation of 133 short videos,&nbsp;<em>Unchained Malady</em>, 2020 – which irreverently repurposes imagery from internet news sites and social media feeds – the exhibition presents a range of works that likewise appropriate found footage, restage familiar formats or scrutinise the mechanisms of the information and entertainment industries. These include American artist Arthur Jafa’s hugely influential&nbsp;<em>Love Is the Message, The Message Is Death</em>&nbsp;(2016), Lisa Reihana’s breakout&nbsp;<em>Wog Features&nbsp;</em>(1990), Dara Birnbaum’s&nbsp;<em>Technology/ Transformation: Wonder Woman</em>&nbsp;(1978–79), and Italian-American ‘electromedia’ pioneer Aldo Tambellini’s&nbsp;<em>Black TV&nbsp;</em>(1968-69), amongst others.</p>



<p>Shaped by artist and theorist Judith Barry’s insight that ‘It is only by&nbsp;<em>producing</em>&nbsp;images that the subject of mass culture begins to feel some measure of control over the alienation produced by this condition” (1986),&nbsp;<em>Image Processors</em>&nbsp;provides a compelling bridge that links the critical aspirations of an artistic avant-garde to the manipulations and blandishments of quotidian entertainment.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><em>…caesuras serve as techniques for modifying subjectivity, activating a process that disrupts perception and feeling and can ultimately generate a transformation, a new way of becoming.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Paul Preciado</em>, Artforum, 2020</p>
<p>A collective pause, a moment to turn inwards – <em>Crossings</em> began with a reflection on the disruptions of 2020. As we shared the experiences of a global pandemic, of shifting political landscapes and transformative action, 2020 was also a time of interiority, of modified subjectivities and heightened anxieties as global lockdowns forced us to turn inwards. Together we withdrew from the world; our most intimate relationships were confined to our bubbles or existed only on screen.</p>
<p><em>Crossings</em> was a group show sparked by these intimacies and distances. It brought together a range of artists and works that registered the polarities of inside and outside, closeness and distance, health and illness and the impacts of larger external forces on our collective subjectivities. But it was not a show about the pandemic. The artists selected worked in a variety of media, were of different generations, had different life experiences and cultural backgrounds. Few of the works were made during or about lockdown. Instead, the show explored how objects, images, and materials carry meanings that are opaque, at the edge of conscious thought, that suggest rather than proclaim. They niggled at the edge of knowing, to articulate the promise and fear of a threshold state.</p>
<p>The works in the exhibition included meditations on public and private spaces and our movements between them; on the body in states of illness, pain, pleasure, reproduction and death; on mobility and change in the face of political and economic turmoil, and on the inevitable impact of an unseen threat that has changed everything. They asked: how can these intimate experiences, fraught relationships, larger forces and their attendant effects be communicated in an art work?</p>
<p><em>Crossings</em> included moving image work from current Walters Prize finalist Sonya Lacey and the first New Zealand screening of Philip Scheffner and Merle Kröger’s filmwork, <em>Havarie</em>, 2016; installations by Next Spring, Grant Lingard, Turumeke Harrington, Yolunda Hickman and Rozana Lee; an artist book by Vivian Lynn; paintings by Emma McIntyre and Layla Rudneva-Mackay; photographic series by Allan McDonald and Richard Shepherd.</p>

<p><u>Grant Lingard</u> was born in Blackball on the West Coast of the South Island and studied at Ilam School of Fine Arts at the University of Canterbury, graduating in 1984. His practice evolved over his short career into a simple language of sculptural forms that combined everyday materials like carved soap, tar and feathers, and men’s underwear, to explore his experience as a gay man in New Zealand. His practice gained a special urgency after his HIV-positive diagnosis, and his untimely death in 1995 marks him as one of the first wave of victims of this illness. He enjoyed attention in the mid-1990s for his important statements concerning his sexuality as it rubbed against the tropes of ‘Kiwi’ masculinity, notably with his inclusion in <em>Art Now: The First Biennial Review of Contemporary Art</em> at Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand in Wellington in 1994, and a string of projects that grew out of his artist-residency at Ilam that same year and in the wake of his death in 1995. Lingard’s work has lately experienced a new wave of interest from a younger generation of artists, curators and writers. His works have been included in: <em>Implicated and Immune</em> (Michael Lett, Auckland, 2015); <em>Sleeping Arrangements</em> (Dowse Art Museum, 2018), and <em>True Love: A Tribute to Grant Lingard</em> (Ilam Campus Gallery, 2021). A website dedicated to his work and memory was established by Jeremiah Boniface on the strength of his Art History Honours’ research undertaken at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
<p><u>Vivian Lynn</u> studied at Canterbury University College School of Art graduating with a Diploma of Fine Art in 1952 and Auckland Teachers’ College, graduating with a Diploma in Teaching in 1953. She undertook further study in printmaking on a research trip to the USA in 1972. She had a long-standing career as a lecturer at the Wellington Polytechnic School of Design (which was amalgamated with Victoria University and then Massey University) teaching drawing between 1974 and her retirement in 1999. Though never aligning herself with the Women’s Art Movement, Lynn was instrumental in coordinating the Women’s Art Archive (1983–84), which is now held at Te Papa. Plagued with long periods of serious illness, Lynn still exhibited in solo and group exhibitions from the late 1950s and was included in several survey exhibitions including <em>Anxious Images</em> (Auckland City Art Gallery, 1984); <em>Content/Context</em> (National Art Gallery, Wellington, 1986), and <em>Alter Image: Negotiating Feminism and Representation in Recent New Zealand Art 1973–1993</em> (City Gallery Wellington, 1993). A major retrospective exhibition <em>I, HERE, NOW Vivian Lynn</em> was staged by the Adam Art Gallery in 2008–9. Since then, her work has enjoyed renewed attention. Two of her installations from the 1980s and 1990s were recently included in the 13th Gwangju Biennale <em>Minds Rising, Spirits Tuning</em>, Gwangju, South Korea, in 2021, and she is now represented by Southard Reid, London. Lynn died at her home in Wellington in 2018.</p>
<p><u>Allan McDonald</u> was born in Lower Hutt. He has been working with photography since the 1960s. He graduated with a Master of Fine Arts from RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia, in 1998. He has produced a number of photobooks including <em>Carbon Empire</em>, which won the 2017 New Zealand Photo Book of the Year award. His work is held in public collections across New Zealand and he has taken part in numerous group exhibitions, ranging from <em>The Active Eye</em> (Manawatu Art Gallery, Palmerston North, 1975) to <em>Freedom Farmers: New Zealand Artists Growing Ideas</em> (Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, 2013-14). McDonald is a lecturer in the School of Creative Industries at Unitec in Auckland. He is represented by Anna Miles Gallery, Auckland.</p>
<p><u>Emma McIntyre</u> was born in Auckland. She graduated with a Bachelor of Visual Art from Auckland University of Technology in 2011, and a MFA from Elam School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland, in 2016. Solo exhibitions include: <em>Pink Square Sways</em> (Hopkinson Mossman, Auckland, 2017); <em>Rose on Red</em> (Hopkinson Mossman, Wellington, 2018); <em>Heat</em> (Mossman, Wellington, 2020), and <em>Pour plenty on the worlds</em> (Chris Sharp Gallery, Los Angeles, 2021). In 2019 she was awarded a Fulbright General Graduate Award to study at Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, CA, and she will graduate this US summer.</p>
<p><em><u>Next Spring</u></em> is an occasional series of texts commissioned, edited and published in book form by Berlin-based New Zealander Laura Preston. Each issue is an essay of art criticism focused on a moving-image work, published both in English and the language of place. O<em>n Distance</em>, an essay by Berlin-based art writer Boaz Levin, written in that city and published in German and English, is the third in the series (the previous publications derived from Paris and Athens respectively).</p>
<p><u>Boaz Levin</u> was born in Jerusalem and currently lives in Berlin. He studied at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design and the Berlin University of the Arts. Together with Hito Steyerl and Vera Tollmann, he co-founded the Research Center for Proxy Politics, and his work has recently been exhibited at the Center for Contemporary Art in Tel Aviv; Human Resources in Los Angeles, and FIDMarseille in Marseille. Since October 2016, Levin has been a PhD candidate as part of the Cultures of Critique research training group at Leuphana University, Lüneburg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Image Processors<br />Artists in the Medium – A Short History 1968–2020</em></strong></p>
<p>Featuring works by Aldo Tambellini, Richard Serra, Dara Birnbaum, Martha Rosler with Paper Tiger TV, Harun Farocki, Lisa Reihana, Megan Dunn, Ryan Trecartin, Wynne Greenwood and K8 Hardy, Josephine Meckseper, Mike Heynes, Arthur Jafa, and Matthew Griffin, curated by Christina Barton.</p>
<p>Opening date to be announced – 7 November 2021</p>

<p><em>Image Processors</em> surveys a history of artists’ moving-image works that take the mass media as their target. Several of the works selected for the exhibition hold key places in the history of video art, yet they have never been brought together in Aotearoa New Zealand previously.<br><br>Working back in time from Australian artist Matthew Griffin’s compilation of 133 short videos, <em>Unchained Malady</em>, 2020 – which irreverently repurposes imagery from internet news sites and social media feeds – the exhibition presents a range of works that likewise appropriate found footage, restage familiar formats or scrutinise the mechanisms of the information and entertainment industries. These include American artist Arthur Jafa’s hugely influential <em>Love Is the Message, The Message Is Death</em> (2016), Lisa Reihana’s breakout <em>Wog Features </em>(1990), Dara Birnbaum’s <em>Technology/ Transformation: Wonder Woman</em> (1978–79), and Italian-American ‘electromedia’ pioneer Aldo Tambellini’s <em>Black TV </em>(1968-69), amongst others.</p>



<p>Shaped by artist and theorist Judith Barry’s insight that ‘It is only by&nbsp;<em>producing</em>&nbsp;images that the subject of mass culture begins to feel some measure of control over the alienation produced by this condition” (1986),&nbsp;<em>Image Processors</em>&nbsp;provides a compelling bridge that links the critical aspirations of an artistic avant-garde to the manipulations and blandishments of quotidian entertainment.</p>

<p><strong><br><em>Crossings </em>(a group show about intimacies and distances)</strong> </p>


<p><a href="https://www.adamartgallery.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Public-programme-text.pdf">Public programme pdf</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Laundry day</em>: a podcast series of unfolding conversations with the artists in <em>Crossings</em></strong> </p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rss.com/podcasts/adamartgallerytepatakatoi/" target="_blank">rss.com/podcasts/adamartgallerytepatakatoi/</a></p>



<p>“At times we phone or Skype. It’s the only way we can talk.” — Rhim Ibrir, <em>Havarie</em>, 2016</p>



<p><em>Crossings </em>is a show about the closeness of distance, the experience of connecting with others from afar, while ensconced in our homes, physically disconnected yet always online. For the duration of the exhibition, we will feature a fortnightly podcast series, pairing artists in <em>Crossings </em>with each other, or with friends and collaborators, to talk about how their practices intersect and collide, sharing readings, films and anecdotes. Recorded from afar, from the contributors’ individual homes, <em>Laundry day </em>is a chance to connect from a distance.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong>Wednesday 30 June, 6pm<br><strong>Wednesdays at the Adam: film screening<br></strong>Todd Haynes, <em>Safe</em>, 1995</strong></p>



<p>In March 2020, <em>The New Yorker </em>described Todd Haynes’ 1995 film <em>Safe </em>as “a tale of two plagues”. “Then, as now,” wrote David Roth, “there is a plague haunting the premises and trying the locks. Then, as now, those in power have disclaimed any responsibility and elected to wait and see how things play out; the President is once again posturing and chuckling through a crisis that he can’t quite bring himself to take seriously.”</p>



<p><em>Safe </em>follows Carol White, played by Julianne Moore, a Californian housewife who develops an acute and sudden sensitivity to unknown elements in her environment – a fable of the AIDS pandemic that has outlasted its original intent, “in large part,” Roth noted, “because the dread at the heart of it—that something invisible and relentless is loose and at prey, and that anyone could become susceptible to it, at which point they would be very much on their own—has never really dispersed. The film’s vision of a culture fundamentally incapable of comprehending or countenancing illness and weakness has insured that <em>Safe </em>has stayed not just unsettling but queasily current.”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong>Wednesday 14 July, 6pm<br>Wednesdays at the Adam: film screening<br>Laura Waddington, </strong><strong><em>Border</em></strong><strong>, 2004, with an introduction by Murdoch Stephens</strong></p>



<p>In 2002, filmmaker Laura Waddington spent months in the fields around Sangatte Red Cross camp in France with Afghan and Iraqi refugees, who were trying to cross the channel tunnel to England. Filmed at night with a small video camera, the figures lit only by<br>the distant car headlights on the motorways, <em>Border </em>is a personal account of the refugees’ plight and the police violence that followed the camp’s closure.</p>



<p>Following the screening, we will have a Q&amp;A with writer and activist Murdoch Stephens, the driving force behind ‘Doing our Bit’, the campaign to double New Zealand’s refugee quota.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong>Wednesday 28 July, 6pm<br><strong>Wednesdays at the Adam: film screening<br></strong>Forugh Farrokhzad, <em>The House is Black</em>, 1962 with an introduction by Richard Shepherd</strong></p>



<p>The only film directed by Iranian poet Forugh Farrokhzad, <em>The House is Black </em>depicts a leper colony near the city of Tabriz in northwest Iran. Accompanied by a voiceover drawn from the Old Testament, the Koran and the filmmaker’s own poetry, the inhabitants of the colony live, worship, learn, play and celebrate in an isolated community shut off from the rest of the world. As <em>The Guardian </em>has recently noted, the film takes on a new meaning in the context of COVID-19: “Our pandemic will pass, but for the quarantined patients in the film, especially those with advanced leprosy, illness and isolation from the rest of society are facts of life.”</p>



<p>The screening will be introduced by Richard Shepherd, whose work <em>Crisis Meeting</em>, 2017, is included in the exhibition. Shepherd is currently undertaking a PhD in Film at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong>Wednesday <strong>11 August</strong>, 6pm<br><strong>Wednesdays at the Adam: film screening<br></strong>Derek Jarman, <em>Blue</em>, 1993</strong></p>



<p>In Derek Jarman’s <em>Blue</em>, the colour becomes a place of refuge that “transcends the solemn geography of human limits.” Consisting solely of a blue screen, with narration from Jarman and friends, <em>Blue </em>was made as Jarman’s health deteriorated from AIDS-related illness, rendering him partially blind, his vision interrupted by blue light.</p>



<p>As Boaz Levin writes in <em>On Distance</em>, “it is as if Jarman’s monochrome screen becomes a retreat from the danger of overexposure, a cure for the redundancy of figurative representation, a space for affect, perhaps, rather than mere sensation.”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong>CANCELLED:</strong> <strong>Saturday 21 August, 1pm–5pm <br>Public/Private<br>Workshop<br>OK319 Seminar Room, Old Kirk Building, Gate 3, Kelburn Parade</strong></p>



<p>A half-day workshop to explore the public/private divide and art’s role in mediating these states. Relevant thinkers and practitioners will address questions such as: what is the ‘public sphere’ today? What role can the public gallery play as an open space in civic life? How do we correlate external labels with internal feelings in the process of making and receiving art works? Limited to 20 participants. To secure a place email ann.gale@vuw.ac.nz. Details of the workshop’s format, contributors, and readings will be distributed prior to the event.</p>

<p><strong>Kate Newby<em> YES TOMORROW</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>20 February – 30 May 2021</strong></p>


<p>Kate Newby has built her career on the principle of ‘travelling light’, responding to locations where she is invited to work by translating her casual observations of things and places into sculptural installations of locally sourced materials, and testing where she can be and what she should do through architectural interventions and site works. Her modus operandi requires her to rely on local knowledge, building networks of helpers to share in her efforts, but also testing audiences’ expectations about what is proper to the art experience.</p>



<p>In December 2020 she flew in to New Zealand from San Antonio Texas, where she is currently based, a return journey conditioned by the COVID pandemic that is curtailing the kind of movement to which Newby has become accustomed. Coming home to make this exhibition has enabled her to reconnect with places –Te Henga on Auckland’s west coast, Paeroa, Whanganui, and Te Whanganui-a-Tara – and people: family members, old friends, artists, makers, and more.</p>



<p><em>YES TOMORROW</em> was therefore a particularly memorable ‘touching down’.&nbsp; It maintained the artist’s customary lightness, as she addressed herself to the Adam Art Gallery’s building and its environs and brought in handmade objects retrieved from storage and made for the occasion. But it also grounded her, took stock of her passage through the art world, crystallising her particular sculptural language, and memorialising those transitory encounters that litter her life. The exhibition unfolded as a set of confident and challenging interventions that recast the relationship between art and its context and invited viewers to look again at the world around them.</p>



<p>Adam Art Gallery Te Pātaka Toi’s invitation to US-based New Zealand artist Kate Newby followed major solo shows by Simon Denny (2014), Kim Pieters (2014), Ruth Buchanan (2016), Luke Willis Thompson (2018) and Edith Amituanai (2019). It was her most substantial exhibition to date. This major undertaking could not have been achieved without substantial assistance. Newby spent time developing her work with a Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant (2019) and an Arts Grant from Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa (2020). The exhibition was realised with generous support from Creative New Zealand Toi Aotearoa; Public Art Fund, Wellington City Council; Te Whare Hēra and Massey University; Jan Warburton Charitable Trust; Jim Barr and Mary Barr; the Congreve family; Michael Lett; The Sunday Painter; Fine Arts, Sydney; Cooper Cole and several anonymous donors.</p>



<p>Kate Newby was born in Auckland in 1979. She studied at Elam School of Fine Arts, graduating with a BFA in 2001 and returning there to undertake a Doctor of Fine Arts, which she completed in 2015. Though quickly establishing herself in the Auckland art scene – she was a founder of Gambia Castle, an artist-run space that operated between 2007 and 2010 on and in the vicinity of Auckland’s Karangahape Road – her career can be charted as a series of itinerant opportunities, with exhibitions in destinations as various as Melbourne, Mexico City, Brussels, Los Angeles, Lisbon, Toronto, Vienna, London, and elsewhere. Newby has undertaken residencies in Germany, Australia, the US, Mexico and Canada, including Chinati Foundation (Marfa, 2012), Fogo Island (Newfoundland, 2012-3), and ISCP (NYC, 2012). She won the Walters Prize in 2012, and was recipient of a Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant in 2019. She has recently moved from Brooklyn, New York, to a small town near San Antonio in Texas. She is represented by Michael Lett, Auckland; Fine Arts, Sydney, The Sunday Painter, London, and Cooper Cole, Toronto.
