  <summary type="text">On Sunday, Hampton residents met with local MP Vince Cable and the local Liberal Democrat Councillors on Sunday to raise concerns about the recent changes in Carlisle Park: a community park that is very popular with families and dog walkers, promotes two children's play areas, has excellent tennis courts, a thriving bowling club and a cricket club in the summer.</summary>

<p>Vince Cable MP and local councillors with Hampton residents who are campaigning against the recent changes to Carlisle Park</p>
</div>
<p>On Sunday, Hampton residents met with local MP Vince Cable and the local Liberal Democrat Councillors on Sunday to raise concerns about the recent changes in Carlisle Park: a community park that is very popular with families and dog walkers, promotes two children's play areas, has excellent tennis courts, a thriving bowling club and a cricket club in the summer.</p>
<p>Major improvements have just been carried out in the park in order to enhance it for all users, improving access and installing new benches and bins.</p>
<p>Now Richmond Borough Council has recently withdrawn the grounds keepers from the park and stopped locking the park at night. This has caused anger among many local residents who were not consulted and cannot see any financial or strategic reason for the decision.</p>
<p>Cllr Suzette Nicholson and Cllr Gareth Roberts welcomed Vince Cable, MP for Twickenham to Carlisle Park to share their views over the plans; they were joined by nearly 80 local residents who raised their concerns with the councillors and Vince Cable about their disappoint over the lack of communication from Richmond Council.</p>
<p>Residents are worried that by no longer keeping the park locked at night there will be an increase in anti-social behaviour and some residents have commented that this has already started.</p>
<p>One parent commented that she no longer feels that the park can be trusted as a safe environment for her children, with the worry of an increase in dangerous objects such as glass impacting the safety of local families using the area. Residents have already reported less cleaning in the park which has resulted in an increase in litter left around the park, with the groundskeeper gone there is now no main point of contact when problems like this arise.</p>
<p>Many residents have sent emails or letters to the council with only a few receiving replies. Residents expressed their frustration with the council for having failing to consult local residents or local stakeholders including ward councillors and the police when making their decision. The vehicle gate is still being locked in the evening, and residents expressed their confusion as to why this cannot continue to extend to the pedestrian gates at the same time.</p>
<p>The Lib Dem ward councillors and Vince Cable are fully supporting the community in calling for this decision to be overturned. Concerned residents organised their own petition which has collected over 160 signatures to date; Cllr Suzette Nicholson will be presenting this to the Conservative council and Cllr Virginia Morris, cabinet member for environment at the next council meeting on Tuesday 23<sup>rd</sup> April.</p>
<p>Vince Cable MP said, "Many residents have been in touch with me regarding their concerns about the changes in Carlisle Park. I fully support the local community's view that this decision should be looked at and I shall be writing to the council to highlight this"</p>
<p>Local Councillors will continue to pressure the council on this issue and recommend that residents do the same. The petition is being presented to the next council meeting on Tuesday 23<sup>rd</sup> April; local residents are more than welcome to attend in the public gallery.</p>

  <summary type="text">The New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership 'Growing Business Fund' is supported by the government's Regional Growth Fund (RGF) and is specifically aimed at helping firms that want to grow but have been held back by a lack of finance.
The fund will provide grants of up to 20%, between £25,000 and £100,000, to business that have a shortfall in their investment plan and are able to create at least one job for every £10,000 provided by the fund.</summary>

<p>The fund will provide grants of up to 20%, between £25,000 and £100,000, to business that have a shortfall in their investment plan and are able to create at least one job for every £10,000 provided by the fund.</p>
<p>The Business Secretary launched the fund at Redpack in Norwich, a company which hopes to benefit from the new fund and expand its existing operations in the city.</p>
<p>Business Secretary Vince Cable said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">A lack of finance is one of the biggest barriers facing firms that want to grow. The government is already taking big steps to help companies bridge that gap and now, thanks to this new fund, businesses across East Anglia will get that helping hand they need.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Through programmes like the New Anglia 'Growing Business Fund', the government's Regional Growth Fund has supported around 1,200 small and medium sized companies across the country, helping them create jobs, increase skills and grow their business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andy Wood, Chairman of New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">The Growing Business Fund will provide a real boost for businesses in Norfolk and Suffolk. Many companies are struggling to secure the investment they need to grow. The Growing Business Fund will make a significant difference in helping to unlock finance for companies with ambitions to create jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">I'm delighted that the Secretary of State has had the opportunity to visit Norfolk and see at first hand some exciting, innovative companies and we hope Redpack will secure the funds they need, through the Growing Business Fund.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vince Cable has been leading development of the government's industrial strategy which looks to the future and presents a long-term, whole of government approach to supporting British business, giving them the confidence they need to invest, hire staff and grow. During his tour of Norfolk he visited local companies with links to two key industrial strategy sectors: agricultural-technology and aerospace.</p>
<p>The day began with a fact-finding visit to British Sugar in King's Lynn ahead of the launch of the agricultural-technology strategy later this year. During the visit the Business Secretary saw the company's revolutionary combined heat and power plant and met apprentices working in the Bio-ethanol workshop. The government believes that agri-tech is a sector that presents significant opportunities for it to work in a long-term partnership with industry to support emerging technologies, develop the skills businesses need and improve business confidence for investment and growth.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State also visited KLM engineering at Norwich Airport. There he spoke about the importance of developing engineering skills and the increasing demand for those skills. In March the government launched the aerospace industrial strategy in partnership with the sector, which had a large focus on skills. The strategy also announced the creation of a £2 billion Aerospace Technology Institute. The institute will allow industry and academic researchers to develop technology for the next generation of quieter, more energy efficient aircraft.</p>

  <title>March Monthly Email from Vince Cable</title>
  <link rel="alternate" href="http://vincentcable.org.uk/en/article/2013/675961/march-monthly-email-from-vince-cable"></link>
  <updated>2013-03-27T13:52:00Z</updated>
  <id>http://vincentcable.org.uk/en/article/2013/675961/march-monthly-email-from-vince-cable</id>
  <summary type="text">Welcome to my second monthly email, I was pleased with the positive response the last one received. I want to continue to keep a balance between what I am doing locally in the community and in government nationally.


One achievement I do want to highlight that effects 82,000 in Richmond Borough, is raising the income tax personal allowance to £10,000 from April 2014, this will provide a £700 tax cut to ordinary workers since the start of this government. Fairer Tax was something I campaigned for during the last election and on the front page of our manifesto; it is great to see this Lib Dem policy helping thousands of people locally.


Big Bang Fair

One of my fun jobs in recent weeks was officially opening the Big Bang Fair at ExCeL. 79,000 school children visited an amazing collection of scientific and engineering exhibits by schools, colleges and companies. Teddington School had an impressive display, and the National Physical Laboratory attracted a large crowd. The aim is to excite children about a science or engineering career.


National Apprenticeship Week

I also led National Apprenticeship week and went around the country meeting young people who have decided to try a vocational rather than academic route. I want to encourage both options on an equal basis. More than 550 people were on an apprenticeship last year in the borough, and I would encourage local businesses to offer more apprenticeships.


SPEAR and Housing

One very moving event was an open day at SPEAR, the homeless charity, at their Heath Road offices. SPEAR's small hostel has rescued many people from life sleeping on the streets. I fear that ever rising rents and house prices in London are driving many low earners away or, in extreme cases onto the streets. We badly need more affordable, including social, housing locally.


Best wishes,


Vince Cable MP

<p>"As part of my role as Business Secretary in the Coalition Government I have promoted and invested heavily in apprenticeships because they are one of the most effective ways of helping young people get jobs. Apprenticeships also allow us to build a stronger economy, with a highly-skilled and flexible workforce.</p>
<p>"Apprenticeships rely on employers making opportunities available and I would encourage local businesses to offer more places to apprentices.</p>
<p>"I am proud of this big boost to apprenticeship starts this government. I hope that National Apprenticeship Week is another opportunity to celebrate the success of our apprentices and for businesses to see how valuable apprentices can be to them."</p>

Platform 20 on Waterloo International will be open to additional and larger (10 car) trains before May 2014, on the Hounslow loop and semi-fast services on the Windsor line. With full 10 car services will be available on the Reading line by 2017.
The station improvements at Whitton are close to final agreement with a better entrance, better cover against the elements on the platforms, and improved facilities for cyclists.
Serious discussions are starting with Cross Rail about an extension to Twickenham via Kingston, improving journey times to many parts of London including Victoria.</summary>

<p>Vince Cable said: "I am delighted that at long last the promised reopening of Waterloo International is going ahead, with new and longer trains coming next year. Apparently there was a long wrangle between South West Trains and Network Rail, which is now resolved."</p>
<p>Hea added: "The go ahead for Whitton station is also welcome and long overdue. The present station is an embarrassment."</p>

<p>In his keynote Leader's speech, Nick paid tribute to the work of the Party in winning the Eastleigh by-election, beating the Conservatives into third place and squeezing Labour while campaigning on the Lib Dem record of delivering in Government.</p>
<p>Nick said:</p>
<p>"Eastleigh. Conference, I have never seen anything like it. Thousands and thousands of activists flooding in from every part of the UK. Young people arriving in their droves. Hitting the pavements, the phones, Facebook, Twitter, email - finding any and every way to drive our message home. I want to thank you all - you were just brilliant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They said we'd never win it. The same critics who try to write us off time and time again. But, you know what? The naysayers can tear up those political obituaries. Liberal Democrats: you proved them wrong. And you proved what we have always known to be true: where we work, we win. There's no great mystery to it. Mike Thornton, Keith House and their team didn't just stop campaigning after the last General Election. They didn't hang up their boots and say: 'We got the seat, that's it for five years'. They kept at it. Recruiting activists. Taking council seats. Building up their support. And when the time came, they were ready. Mike, Keith, everyone who helped: You ran an exemplary campaign; you have electrified this party - thank you very, very much.</p>
<p>The challenge now, Conference, is building on this momentum. As we approach the upcoming council elections in May. As we prepare for the General Election. We need to be clear on the lesson from Eastleigh: The odds were stacked against us. A fierce campaign, under a national spotlight, dogged by difficult headlines from day one. Extraordinary circumstances. Yet we still won. We beat the Tories. We squeezed Labour - don't forget that bit. We won.</p>
<p>Why? Because, for the first time in a generation we could campaign on our record of local delivery and our record of national delivery too. Every leaflet dropped in the Eastleigh campaign combined both. And, when people took a long, hard look they liked what they saw. We didn't win in Eastleigh in spite of being in power. We won in Eastleigh because we're in power - locally and nationally. It's important that everyone in this room knows that.</p>
<p>It's three years since we took the decision to go into Government. I know some of you have had a quiet fear, ticking away at the back of your minds. The worry that the risk we took was too big. No, Liberal Democrats. It may have been a risk, but we took it for the right reasons: to steer Britain through a time of economic crisis; to govern in the national interest; to govern from the centre ground; to build a stronger economy, in a fairer society, enabling everyone in Britain to get on in life.</p>
<p>And that decision will pay off - for the country, and for us too. There is a myth that governing together, in coalition, diminishes the ability of the smaller party to beat the bigger party. The idea that, in Tory facing seats the Liberal Democrats will find it impossible to distinguish our record, our values, from theirs. But that myth has been utterly confounded. The opposite is true. The longer you stand side-by-side with your opponents, the easier your differences are to see. We don't lose our identity by governing with the Conservatives. The comparison helps the British people understand who we are.</p>
<p><strong>And we are the party that shares the country's priorities: Fair taxes; better schools; jobs. The only party that will deliver a stronger economy and a fairer society, enabling every one to get on in life.</strong></p>
<p>In the days after the by-election, even though we won, I was asked how I feel about our party no longer being a magnet for the protest vote. No longer the automatic 'none-of-the-above' choice. And my reply was this: the Liberal Democrats are not a party of protest, we are a party of change. A party that is for things, not simply against things. A successful political party cannot thrive just by picking up the votes that have been lost by its opponents. Our ambition is to reach out to the millions of people in this country who want a party that strikes the right balance between economic credibility and social fairness. We are not some kind of receptacle for people who don't like the world - and don't want to do anything about it. We grapple with the world. We strive to make it better. And the more people who see that, all the better too.</p>
<p>Conference, I don't pretend it's all sunny uplands from here. This journey we are on is not an easy one. As a party: from opposition to government. As a country: from austerity to prosperity. We will be tested more times along the way. And, throughout this journey, our focus will be the country's focus. The economy. Britain's economic recovery has proved more challenging than anyone imagined. The crash in 2008, deeper and more profound than we knew. Just two weeks ago, the uncertain outcome of the Italian election threatened to plunge Europe back into crisis. Suddenly we were reminded of the danger that looms when markets question the ability of governments to live within their means. Countries around the world face the same, hard truth: We must all pay the piper in the end. I want to make one thing clear: We will not flinch on the deficit. But to be unflinching is not to be unthinking. And the idea that the choice is between a cruel and unbending Plan A and a mythical plan B is simply not the case.</p>
<p>Balancing the books is a judgement, not a science. And our plan has always allowed room for manoeuvre. One of the most important things I have learnt in Government is this: in a fluid, fast-moving global economic environment, sticking to a plan requires government to be flexible, as well as resolute. Nimble, as well as determined. When economic circumstances around us deteriorated and UK growth forecasts suffered, voices on the right called for us to respond by cutting further and faster. But instead we took the pragmatic choice to extend the deficit reduction timetable. As tax receipts went down we let the automatic ebb and flow of government borrowing fill the gap. And it is simply not true - as our critics on the left pretend - that we are slashing and burning the state. By the end of this Parliament, public spending will still be 42% of GDP. That's higher than at any time between 1995 and when the banks crashed, in 2008. And most importantly, reducing the deficit is essential, but as a means to an end. And that end is lasting, sustainable growth. Sound public finances are one piece of the jigsaw. But so are better skills, more apprenticeships, smarter regulation, a more competitive tax regime for business. All of which we are delivering.</p>
<p>And, yes, productive investment in our infrastructure too: energy, housing, transport. Creating jobs today and boosting the long-term strength of our economy: the extension of High Speed Rail; the new network of technology centres; the Green Investment Bank; Cross Rail - the biggest construction project in Europe. And, in an unprecedented break from the straitjacket of Treasury orthodoxy, an offer of £50bn worth of guarantees from central government to those people willing to invest in UK's infrastructure and get construction going. No government has offered these kinds of guarantees, on this scale, ever before. And this year, Conference, we are spending more on capital than Labour spent, on average, between 1997 and 2010.</p>
<p>So let no one tell you that this Government isn't straining every sinew to invest every available pound into UK infrastructure. We will and must do more to mobilise investment into our long-term infrastructure needs. I agree with that. Vince agrees with that. Danny agrees with that. But, as we all equally acknowledge, there are no cost-free, risk-free ways of finding such huge sums of money. Not at a time when Labour left the cupboard bare and we still have the second highest deficit in Europe, behind only Greece. Ours is a growth strategy guided by liberal pragmatism from a Coalition government anchored firmly in the centre ground. The deficit down by a quarter. Fixing our banks. A million jobs created in the private sector. Money back in people's pockets. A stronger economy, a fairer society, enabling everyone to get on in life.</p>
<p>In the middle of the 20 Century, as Britain emerged from the ravages of war, its leaders were forced to think anew - just as we are now. The great liberal, Sir William Beveridge, established the modern welfare state, transforming this country forever. He said 'Liberalism is a faith, not a formula'. And what he meant is that liberalism is a set of timeless principles, married to an unshakeable belief in human progress. That is why liberals never run from change. Our role remains the same today. In this Coalition Government, so much of the radical thinking on economic reform is liberal-led. Not just rebuilding the old economy. Not just repeating the same mistakes of the past. But building an economy that is resilient, sustainable, open, green. Ideas deliberated in this conference hall, now being administered by thousands of civil servants, in order to benefit millions of British citizens. The world's first ever Green Investment Bank. The Business Bank; the bank levy; the Green Deal. Better schools and proper vocational learning. Greater shareholder democracy. Flexible working and shared parental leave. Tax cuts for working families, paid for by higher taxes on unearned wealth. We may be the smaller party, Conference, but we have all the biggest ideas.</p>
<p>And, remember: no one will know what we stand for unless we stand together. As our opponents argue among themselves and turn inwards it is even more important that we build on - rather than squander - the magnificent resolve and unity we have shown over the last three years. That unity is what our enemies most fear. That unity should make us proud.</p>
<p>Most importantly, liberals understand that economic renewal must be accompanied by social renewal. A stronger economy needs a fairer society. That is what this is about. Strong growth creates jobs and opportunities. If citizens are empowered and educated they are better able to grasp those opportunities. Their achievements, in turn, drive prosperity. Yet the Conservative and Labour governments of the past have, together, built a Britain characterised by intense concentrations of power. They allowed opportunity to be hoarded among elites. The untold story of the boom years is a story of lost potential. Previous governments placed unquestioning faith in London's financial sector. And it led them to squander the talents and prospects of dozens of places, and millions of people. GDP may have been rising, but in some of our biggest cities, former industrial powerhouses like Nottingham and Birmingham, the private sector workforces were actually shrinking. One square mile may have been raking in astronomical profits. But we are a country of 100,000 square miles. And across the nation, communities suffered serious neglect.</p>
<p>And just as Labour and the Conservatives allowed our economy to become grossly unbalanced, they ignored deep social divides too. Despite the steps we have taken in Government, Britain remains a place where, for the vast majority of people, the life you are born into still determines the life you lead. It doesn't have to be like that. Yesterday I spoke to someone I've gotten to know over the last few years. A man called Kevin McLoughlin who owns a painting and decorating company in London. Kevin left school at 15. His dad was disabled. His mum was out of work. But he managed to get an apprenticeship. 40 years later and his business is thriving. He now gives the same opportunity to hundreds of youngsters. He told me his main motivation is simply to build a successful, profitable business. These young men and women are an asset to his company. But he also said, the reason he keeps doing it is he doesn't believe for one moment that British youngsters don't want to work - someone just needs to give them a chance. To be a liberal is to know that every man, woman and child is capable of remarkable things. That there is something extraordinary in every person. To be a liberal is to know that when we, as individuals, flourish, we, as a society, become greater than the sum of our parts.</p>
<p>And to be a liberal in government is to help every individual be the best they can be. A fairer society. That's what the Pupil Premium is for. Billions of pounds to stop poor children falling behind. More free childcare. City Deals transferring economic powers from Whitehall to every corner of the UK. The biggest ever cash rise in the state pension; a generous new flat rate pension. And of course, raising the point at which people start paying income tax. So that millions of low earners pay none at all. And, as of April, millions of working people will be £600 better off. Liberal Democrat policies, delivered by Liberal Democrat ministers. Creating a stronger economy and a fairer society, enabling everyone to get on in life.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, on their own, will never deliver the fairer society - it's just not who they are. Take the Mansion tax. Even now, when millions of families are feeling the pinch, they still refuse to ask people who live in multi-million pound homes to chip in a bit more. The Conservative party knows it needs to stay on the centre ground to have any chance of speaking to ordinary people's concerns. At least the leadership seem to. But they just can't manage it, no matter how hard they try. They're like a kind of broken shopping trolley. Every time you try and push them straight ahead they veer off to the right hand side.</p>
<p>Did you notice the bizarre mixed messages from the Conservative party after Eastleigh? An article in one Sunday newspaper, promising: no lurch to the right. Others splashed with the promise to pull the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights. Something only one other European country has done: Belarus. The Conservatives would actively take away rights enjoyed by British citizens just to appease their backbenchers. Yesterday Theresa May made a speech arguing the option of leaving the Convention should remain 'on the table'. Well, I tell you, it won't be on the Cabinet Table so long as I'm sitting round it. Conference, make no mistake, no matter what the issue: Safeguarding the NHS, creating green jobs, stopping profit-making in schools, preventing a return to two tier O Levels, the Liberal Democrats will keep the Coalition firmly anchored in the centre ground.</p>
<p>What's the only thing as unlikely as the Tories delivering a fairer society? Labour delivering a stronger economy. Let's recap. First they destroy the economy. They spend all the money. They leave us with nothing. Then they oppose every single saving the Coalition has been forced to make with not a single suggestion for how to raise money instead. Then they finally do come up with an idea. And it's brilliant. But it's the Mansion Tax - and we came up with it first. Labour are embracing opposition in the worst possible way. All they are interested in is striking poses and playing parliamentary games. They try to lecture us about taxing the rich. Even though taxes on the richest are now higher than they were for every year under thirteen years of Labour. They conspired with Tory rebels to scupper Lords Reform, even though it was in their manifesto. By now I expected a re-energised Labour party, re-focused. The whole point of opposition parties is that they come up with ideas. But they haven't. Under Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, Labour remain a blank page in British politics. These people were in the government that crashed the economy before. They've given us no apology. No solutions. No plans. No sign that they even understand what they did. The truth is, left to their own devices, they'd do it again. And, I'm sorry, but you do not stand tall for one nation when you still bow to the union barons.</p>
<p>You can't trust Labour to build a strong economy. You can't trust the Tories to build a fair society. Only the Liberal Democrats can deliver a stronger economy and a fairer society, enabling everyone to get on in life. Get used to those words, Conference. Get used to saying them. That's the message I need you to deliver across the country. I need you to explain it to people each and every day, from now, for the next two years and beyond. Tell them that only the Liberal Democrats have the values and ideas to build a better future. Tell them that only we can deliver the stronger economy and fairer society Britain needs.</p>
<p>Conference, we are on the eve of an important anniversary: It is ten years since the invasion of Iraq. Ten years since we opposed that war. Standing on our own within Parliament but with the people, outside of it. As I look back I am reminded of all of the times that the Liberal Democrats have led, rather than followed. Whether under Paddy Ashdown, as early converts in the fight against climate change. Whether as a lone voice warning against corporate recklessness and greed. Whether as a pioneer for equal rights, irrespective of colour, gender and creed. Regardless of whether you are old or young; rich or poor; gay or straight. Those memories are proud memories. But there's a big difference between now and then. In the past we may have been right - but we couldn't do anything about it. Now we can. Think of equal marriage. Not just an idea in this hall, but the law of the land because of us.</p>
<p>We know that change is not always possible overnight. We know that reform is always met with anger by those who cling to the status quo. But we also know that, if you have the argument on your side. If you have the courage of your convictions, change is only a matter of time. Liberal Democrats, I have spent nearly three years asking you to hold firm. Three years urging you to remain steady under fire. And you have.</p>
<p><strong>"But today, Liberal Democrats, I have a different message for you: Win. Get back out there. Tell our side of the story. And we will win again. On the door step, in town halls, in government. Keep fighting for what we believe in. Keep winning. Building a stronger economy, a fairer society, enabling everyone to get on in life."</strong></p>

  <summary type="text">Figures released by UCAS today show that the number of applications for higher education by people living in England has risen by 3 per cent year-on-year.
Among 18-year olds, the application rate has risen by 1 per cent to 34.8 per cent and is the second highest level on record. The application rate for 18-year olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds has risen to 19.5 per cent, the highest on record - up from 10.7 per cent in 2004.</summary>

<p>Commenting on today's UCAS figures, <strong>Business Secretary and Twickenham MP Vince Cable</strong> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These encouraging figures confound the critics and pessimists who were predicting that the new system of student financing would deter young people from applying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is especially striking is that students from poorer backgrounds are not put off from applying. Today's figures - an all time high- clearly show they are not. Government is increasing funding for the National Scholarship Programme, which institutions can use to provide benefits including bursaries and grants, from £50m in this academic year to £150m in 2014-15.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is clearly now a better understanding of the Government's reforms. New students will not pay anything upfront, there is more financial support for those from poorer families and repayments are related to ability to pay subsequent to graduation, in what is in effect a graduate tax."</p>

  <summary type="text">Business Secretary Vince Cable has today (30 January 2013) written to the Chairman and CEOs of the last seven FTSE 100 firms with all-male boards, urging them to take action to increase the number of women in the boardroom.
The letter from the Business Secretary comes on the back of the announcement by Randgold Resources that Jeanine Mabunda Lioko has joined its board as a non-executive director.</summary>
  <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Business Secretary Vince Cable has today (30 January 2013) written to the Chairman and CEOs of the last seven FTSE 100 firms with all-male boards, urging them to take action to increase the number of women in the boardroom.</p>
<p>The letter from the Business Secretary comes on the back of the announcement by Randgold Resources that Jeanine Mabunda Lioko has joined its board as a non-executive director.</p>
<p>He has asked the remaining companies, Antofagasta, Croda, Glencore, Xstrata, Kazakhmys, Melrose and Vedanta, to explain what steps they have taken to increase their female board representation and how they plan to make their boardrooms more diverse. The number of all-male FTSE 100 boards has fallen from 21 in 2010.</p>
<p>Business Secretary Vince Cable said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Over the last two and a half years we have seen real progress in the number of talented women reaching the boards of our top companies. During that time the number of all-male boards has fallen from 21 to the last seven remaining today, with the welcome news from mining giant Randgold being the latest step. My vision by 2015 is that Britain will not have a single FTSE 100 board without a significant female presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Businesses should be making sure they have the right people around their top table. This is not about equality, this is about good governance and good business. The international evidence supports this: diverse boards are better boards benefiting from fresh perspectives, opinions and new ideas which ultimately serve the company's long term interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I do recognise that for some businesses, like those in the mining and extractives industry in particular, there are unique challenges in diversifying their boards with the right experience. The frequent travel and project based work in remote areas of the world have all been cited as barriers to appointing more women in the past. However, successful modern companies learn to adapt and survive and doing nothing is not an option anymore. We've seen examples again today that this can be done and I am determined to see further action."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In line with the efforts to increase boardroom diversity, last week Vince Cable announced that three of the five appointments to the Business Bank Advisory Group will be female. In addition, he also announced that Dale Murray was the latest female non-executive appointment to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills' Departmental Board. Seven of the 21 attending the Departmental Board, and four of the nine attending the Executive Board, are female.</p>

The payment is a fixed amount for each week of cold weather. For many years this was set at £8.50 per week. The Coalition Government has made the £25 rate permanent. Last year - winter 2011/2012 - 5.2 million individual payments were made, worth a total of £129.2 million.</p>
<p>To 'trigger' the payments, the average temperature at a specified weather station must be recorded as, or forecast to be, 0°C or below for seven consecutive days. The scheme runs from 1 November to 31 March each winter.</p>
<p>Commenting, Liberal Democrat MP Vince Cable said:
<br />
<br />
"I'm glad that during these really cold periods, the Coalition Government is giving vulnerable residents extra money to cover the cost of their energy bills.
<br />
<br />
"Payments are made automatically to those entitled to them. There should be no need to make a claim, but constituents of Twickenham who think they may be entitled but do not receive a payment can contact me - and my team will investigate for them."

  <title>Vince Cable Speech: The EU</title>
  <link rel="alternate" href="http://vincentcable.org.uk/en/article/2013/651860/vince-cable-speech-the-eu"></link>
  <updated>2013-01-21T13:32:00Z</updated>
  <id>http://vincentcable.org.uk/en/article/2013/651860/vince-cable-speech-the-eu</id>
  <summary type="text">This discussion takes place in the context of an important debate in the future of the UK in the EU. You will be eagerly looking forward to what the PM has to say tomorrow.
There is plenty of scope for debating the merits and demerits of particular aspects of the European project; there is undoubtedly scope for far reaching reform; and there is clearly a 'democratic deficit' of popular disenchantment in the UK, which the political classes have to deal with. But renegotiation is different from reform. Reform implies building up arguments and alliances for change within the EU. Renegotiation may relate to the same agenda but implies that the UK will walk if it fails to achieve its negotiating objectives.</summary>

<p>There is plenty of scope for debating the merits and demerits of particular aspects of the European project; there is undoubtedly scope for far reaching reform; and there is clearly a 'democratic deficit' of popular disenchantment in the UK, which the political classes have to deal with. But renegotiation is different from reform. Reform implies building up arguments and alliances for change within the EU. Renegotiation may relate to the same agenda but implies that the UK will walk if it fails to achieve its negotiating objectives.</p>
<p>Uncertainty matters. Business wants certainty. Certainty to invest and create jobs. Any reopening the whole question of British membership creates additional uncertainty at a time when there is already fragile economic confidence in the wake of the financial crisis. This uncertainty is potentially driving away investors and the jobs they create. Surveys show that 50% of inward investors cite Britain's unfettered access and substantial influence over the Single Market as a core reason for investing in the UK. In an internationally competitive environment they are being invited to reconsider whether Britain's fixture in the Single Market is secure. I have never met or heard of a business that exports widely, within or beyond Europe, that thinks it would be better to be doing this from outside the EU. And I meet more businesses than any other Minister. I make this point as a Minister who has to persuade Asian and US investors to take Britain seriously and create employment here rather than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Why has the issue of UK membership suddenly erupted in this way? There are several factors at work here. First of all, there is an identity issue. It is hardly a coincidence that the Europe issue has emerged while the future of the UK is at stake in the 2014 Scottish election campaign, where many of the arguments echo the EU debate. The EU arguments are also linked in the public mind - and support for the UKIP - with a separate but related issue: immigration. Two decades ago I wrote about an emerging<strong>'</strong>politics of identity'. Our historical experience of economic crises - going back to such events as the South Sea Bubble through the 1930's - is that the distress triggers nationalism and other expressions of identity. We are a long way from the destructive conflicts of the 1930's but much damage could still be done.</p>
<p>One particular factor affecting British public opinion has been the change in context from when Britain voted in a referendum to join the European Union (or Economic Community as it then was). Post imperial Britain was struggling economically with relatively poor performance. The EU by contrast was a success story; Britain had negotiated admission to a club with a dynamic economy. The current context is very different. It is quite clear that the Eurozone (as well as the UK) faces profound problems. But there is also a changing global centre of economic gravity as the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America offer more export potential than Europe. It is far from obvious that adapting to the changing world economy and the rise of complex global value chains and exploiting the potential of emerging markets is best pursued outside the EU.</p>
<p>A key part of my job - and fellow Ministers across the Coalition - is to promote trade and inward investment opportunities with China, India, Russia and Brazil (and also Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and other emerging economies); and recent trends are encouraging. The trade agreements which frame access to some of these markets are being negotiated at EU level (Korea, potentially India, ASEAN and Mercosur countries, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada and Japan). And the prospect of an EU-US free trade deal is now, thanks in part to UK leadership, firmly on the political agenda.</p>
<p>There are some genuine complaints and grievances about the working of the EU which do need to be addressed through reform. It is a legitimate criticism that the European elite has for too long ignored some of these problems. In particular at a time of severe economics stress in many states of Europe, the sense that the Commission and European Parliament are enjoying the benefit of a generous gravy train grates badly, and not only in Britain.</p>
<p>It is worth recalling what the main British Eurosceptic complaints are and whether these can best be remedied by reform as opposed to attempted renegotiation leading to possible exit through a referendum on the terms of renegotiation. First, there is the Common Agricultural Policy: undeniably protectionist, wasteful and economically unjustifiable but less important and somewhat reformed since Britain voted to join. Second, then is the European budget, inflated and inefficient and protected by a Commission whose officials appear grossly insensitive to the priorities of Ministers in member governments, like me, forced to administer severe cuts. There is support elsewhere in the EU for strong budget discipline; the UK, unlike Germany, has a rebate; and the net cost of a little over 0.10% of GDP hardly justifies exit, especially as it would continued to be paid if Britain reverted to a Norwegian type of status in the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>And, thirdly, I deal with small business groups as well as big companies and there is legitimate disenchantment amongst small business with the bureaucratic red tape generated by EU directives and regulations around, for example social legislation, but also unnecessary harmonisation within the Single Market. There is however now a wide and growing consensus in the EU for reforming regulation along the lines of the ten proposals for reform I recently put forward to the "likeminded group" of EU Ministers . And some of the most potentially damaging pieces of social legislation - for business - as in the Working Time Directive are being held at bay by a blocking minority under QMV which could dissolve if Britain is perceived to be disengaging from the EU.</p>
<p>In truth however, these grumbles, which have been aired in various forms over the last 50 years, and managed, are not the nub of the problem. It is more the public perception that the European Union is heading towards closer political union and a common European identity, which the British do not share, being more concerned with the more limited 'bread and butter' economic agenda centred on the Single Market.</p>
<p>Britain's future in Europe is not going to be dictated by a handful of Europhile 'federalists' on the one hand or by an equally unrepresentative group of Europhobes on the other. The pragmatic, semi detached, majority which I know includes the vast majority of coalition colleagues will acknowledge that the European project has been in many respects a force for good: it has helped transform Europe from a battlefield to a prosperous trading unit; it has absorbed former authoritarian states in Southern Europe (though the resilience of their new democracies is being sorely tested at present); more remarkably it has absorbed ten former Communist countries; helping to spread liberal democratic values and open societies; and it enables medium sized countries like ours to be taken seriously, through common trade negotiation and on big global issues like climate change.</p>
<p>But the sceptical member of the public will reasonably ask: what has Europe done for me? Are there alternatives which are feasible and cost less? This takes us to the Single Market: just under half of UK's exports of goods and services are sold into the Single Market; 3.5 million British workers have jobs which depend on our ability to trade freely across the Single Market. Although the Single Market is far from complete - there is not yet a fully effective Single Market in services or energy, or digital/e-commerce-economic studies show that the opening up of EU markets has added significantly to our economic welfare: up to an estimated £3,300 per household per year over the last 20 years- and could add more if liberalisation were to be pursued. The "four freedoms"- freedom of trade in both goods and services, freedom of movement of both capital and labour- has represented a unifying theme for liberal minded people and business across a wide political spectrum. The importance of the Single Market lies not just in the dismantling of trade barriers and national regulations which act as trade barriers. It also provides a set of rules disciplining state aid which would be ruinously expensive for cash strapped governments like ours if a free-for-all was allowed. Indeed last week I spoke alongside the Commissioner for Competition who praised Britain as a voice of sanity on this issue. It acts as a powerful brake on intra-EU protectionism in areas like public procurement. More generally it keeps the genie of economic nationalism in the bottle.</p>
<p>Precisely the same arguments for a single European market apply to a single UK market, which is why it is odd to see that so many Eurosceptics who are willing (or willing to risk) UK withdrawal are also passionately committed to the UK union, and single market.</p>
<p>Although UK participation in the Single Market is assumed, even by Eurosceptics who believe it can be preserved through a Norwegian or Swiss arrangement, this Single Market is not above criticism by any means. First, the process of integration has led to a degree of harmonisation of standards and rules (as well as some mutual recognition of different rules). While such harmonisation can benefit business, reducing the costs of operating in EU markets, it has itself become a source of friction. The business complaints about red tape and the myths of Eurocrats demanding straight bananas and square tomatoes mostly stem from over-zealous application of Single Market rules. The groans from the City about EU regulation stem from attempts to create a Single Market in financial services. For this reason there is a growing business constituency, especially amongst SMEs, which argues that the costs of intrusive harmonisation in the Single Market may outweigh the benefit. That argument has to be taken seriously and there has to be confidence that reform can address it. I regard it as one of my responsibilities to speak up for small business which is frustrated by regulatory overload within the Single Market.</p>
<p>A single market also entails free movement of labour as well as capital, goods and services- one of the four freedoms. And it is the perceived 'threat' of immigration from low wage Eastern Europe that accounts for much of the current popular disenchantment with the European project- though the anxieties are not just confined to the UK and may well require some restrictions on free movement from the Balkans and any new applicants. There is however a certain irony in Euro scepticism on the Right attacking the EU for being insufficiently market friendly and then complaining that some markets work too well.</p>
<p>Looking forward, the Single Market and its benefits for the UK are now under threat from two directions. The first derives from the move to closer integration in the Eurozone with the Eurozone becoming the effective decision making body for the Single Market, and the UK as a Eurozone "out" becoming increasingly marginalised. This process could happen most readily in financial services but could extend to tax harmonisation as fiscal policy becomes more integrated. The threat to the integrity of the single market, and to Britain's place and voice within it, is real and should be a priority over the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>But, the second threat is self-inflicted. It will be difficult enough to safeguard UK national interests in the Single Market in an environment where the UK stands aside from closer economic and political integration in the Eurozone. It could become next to impossible if the UK is simultaneously seeking to disengage from substantial existing commitments, especially if we are perceived to be blocking closer integration in projects we are not part of. The Eurosceptic calculation is that British permission is necessary for closer integration- via treaty change- and that this permission can be traded for the negotiating objectives. That seems to me a dangerous gamble to make. There are many in Europe, notably in France, who would be happy to see the back of the UK (whatever that may mean in practice) and even the UK's allies on market reform (notably Germany) have limited political capital to spend getting a more favourable arrangement for the UK. Others are understandably concerned that special treatment for Britain could lead to a host of other demands by member states with specific problems and risk paralysis. It is right that, as a government, we look at the "balance of competences" and pursue greater subsidiarity where decisions are best made nationally or locally; but this process is not helped by threats to walk out when we don't get our way.</p>
<p>That leaves the political question of whether or not to hold an in/out referendum. There is a lot to be said for supporters of continued British membership of the EU embracing a referendum. It would lance the boil of suspicion that British membership is primarily supported by a deracinated Europhile elite disconnected from and distrustful of the public. It would expose contradictions amongst those who favour exit for a variety of different reasons and favour a variety of mutually exclusive alternatives. What crystallised the perception of the No campaign in 1975 was the sight of opponents arguing from the Left that the EU was a wicked promarket capitalist club and from the Right that the EU was a wicked socialist anti-market club. The opening of the 2014 Scottish referendum campaign is beginning to expose contradictions and a lack of clarity amongst supporters of Scottish independence.</p>
<p>So an argument can be made in principle for a referendum. Indeed the Coalition has already passed legislation specifying when a referendum should be triggered. What is however clear is that this is a terrible time to have the diversion and uncertainty which build up to a referendum would entail. It is far from clear what the rival propositions actually mean. We simply do not know what structures and governance will emerge from the Eurozone crisis or what it means for the UK. It is totally unclear whether the other members of the EU will be willing to negotiate new terms for the UK and on what basis. Uncertainty is the enemy of investment. At a time of extreme fragility in business confidence such uncertainty would add to the sense of unresolved crisis and weaken Britain's ability to deliver more reform inside the EU.</p>

<p>Nicola Adams' Gold: A Moment To Remember for 2012</p>
</div>
<p>The last twelve months have been lit up by moments that will stay with us forever. When Mo Farah approached the final stretch of the 10,000m final, who wasn't up on their feet, screaming at the TV?</p>
<p>When Nicola Adams beamed at the crowd after winning the first ever women's Olympic boxing, who didn't smile back? I was lucky enough to be there, and that's one I'll never forget.</p>
<p>Was there anything more British than that drenched choir in the Jubilee River Pageant, singing Rule Britannia! in the pouring rain?</p>
<p>Incredible images. Spectacular shows. Jaw-dropping personal triumphs.</p>
<p>And, above all, a year defined by shared experiences and national spirit too.</p>
<p>As for 2013, there will be more great moments, I'm sure, and some big challenges as well.</p>
<p>Many families are still feeling the squeeze. Look at the world around us and you see continuing economic uncertainty - particularly in our European backyard. We are living through fluid, difficult times.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is that, whatever 2013 throws at us, the Liberal Democrats will continue to anchor this Coalition in the centre ground and we will hold firm to our key purpose in this government: the Liberal Democrats are building a stronger economy, in a fairer society, enabling every person to get on in life.</p>
<p>Over the holidays people want a break from politics as much as from work - I know that. But as you look to the year ahead, you also deserve the reassurance that your government has a plan to steer the country onto better times - and that we're going to stick to it.</p>
<p>So I want you to hear it from me, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, that this Coalition Government is not going to lurch one way or the next.</p>
<p>We will stay the course on the deficit. We will cut income tax bills and help with childcare bills. We will invest in boosting jobs and we'll reform welfare to get people into work.</p>
<p>A stronger economy - a fairer society, where everyone can get on. That's what we're about. That's what I want 2013 to be about.</p>
<p>And, however you usher it in, I hope you have a fantastic time. Happy New Year!</p>

(Friday 14th December)
<br />
<br />
The presentation, held at the newly refurbished United Reformed Church Hall, saw 19 pupils collect their prize of a lovely House of Commons teddy bear, for their best in school entry.</p>
<p>With an overwhelming response Dr Cable selected Josh Brentall, age 8 from Archdeacon Cambridge's Primary School as this year's overall winner. The winning design is featured on the front of the card sent to over 45,000 households in Twickenham, Whitton, Teddington, St Margaret's and the Hamptons.</p>
<p>Runners up Beatrice O'Riordan (Hampton Junior School), Vinuda Rodrigo (St Edmund's Primary School), Olivia Lewis (Carlisle Infants School), and Alice Johnson (Chase Bridge Primary School) have their designs displayed on the back of the card. For the first year Dr Cable will also be displaying all of the school winners' designs on his flickr account: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vincecable/sets/72157632145117386/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/vincecable/sets/72157632145117386/</a></p>
<p>Dr Cable said, "Every year choosing a winner for this competition gets more difficult, with an incredible amount of entries this year it made my job of selecting the best designs very tough. I want to thank all of the pupils who sent in entries, and I was very impressed with the imagination that went in to creating all of the cards."</p>

  <summary type="text">On Friday local MP Vince Cable, met with four students from Newland House School, Twickenham to launch their campaign which will help motorists save fuel and help cut carbon emissions. Sainsbury's have given the green light to trial their campaign at their St. Clare's store which involves customer awareness at petrol stations to get motorists to check their tyre pressure.</summary>

Sainsbury's have given the green light to trial their campaign at their St. Clare's store which involves customer awareness at petrol stations to get motorists to check their tyre pressure.</p>
<p>13-year-old Hector Kelly, Max Evans, Patrick Bamforth and Jaydon Softly spotted an opportunity for petrol retailers to promote fuel efficiency measures to their customers. They were delighted when Sainsbury's welcomed their idea of an awareness campaign for motorists after their findings revealed that if 400 motorists check their tyre pressure regularly it could help them save fuel, reduce carbon emissions (43 tonnes of CO2), and save one fuel tanker 19,000 litres of fuel a year.</p>
<p>The boys explored a number of solutions, including pressure sensing valve caps, but decided that a visible reminder to motorists on the petrol forecourt would have a more significant impact on CO2 reduction in the UK.</p>
<p>Richard Crampton, Head of Fuel at Sainsbury's, said: "We're always on the look out for innovative ways to help our customers and protect the environment. So when we heard about this we thought it was well worth a try. It's great to be able to help take their experiment from the classroom to our customers' cars."</p>
<p>Barry McGovern, Departmental Head - Design Technology, at Newland House School said: "I am delighted with the outcome of this project. It is the culmination of 18 months hard work and although the boys are only 13 their project has the potential of helping to reduce CO2 levels both now and in the long term in the UK."</p>
<p>The campaign has also been highly commended by local MP Vince Cable who today met Barry and the boys. Dr Cable said: "In these tough times it's really encouraging to see big business embrace ideas from young minds in this way. It demonstrates that young people have so much potential and that there are businesses out there that are willing to try out new ideas. I hope that Sainsbury's customers in Hampton will get behind this very worthwhile initiative."</p>
<p>Sainsbury's begins the trial of the campaign this month at its store at St Clare's, Hampton. Over the next six months Sainsbury's and the students will see how successful it is</p>
<p>Sainsbury's support is the icing on the cake for the four boys. Earlier this year they won a British Science Association Silver CREST award and they were runners up in the under 16 category at the National Science and Engineering Competition.</p>

  <title>Government sets out steps to change culture in UK equity markets</title>

  <summary type="text">The need for a fundamental change in the culture of investment was endorsed by Business Secretary Vince Cable today in his response to Professor John Kay's independent Review of UK Equity Markets.



Dr Cable set out his support for Professor Kay's 10 Principles for Equity Markets, which focus on reversing the culture of short-termism and restoring relationships of trust and confidence in the investment chain. The Government also committed to exploring whether changes in law or regulation are needed to deliver Kay's principles in practice.


Today's response sets out the work Government is taking forward to deliver Kay's recommendations, including:

Working with EU counterparts to end mandatory quarterly reporting and help reduce the excessive focus on short-term earnings;
Endorsing clear minimum standards of behaviour for all investment intermediaries to ensure they act in the long-term best interests of their clients. The Law Commission has been asked to review the legal obligations on intermediaries, to take appropriate long-term factors into account. The FSA has also been asked to ensure that the regulatory framework promotes high standards of behaviour throughout the investment chain;
Encouraging industry to establish an Investors' Forum to champion constructive engagement with companies;
Endorsing Good Practice Statements for company directors, asset managers and asset holders, which emphasise the need for trust-based relationships and advocate more collective action by institutional shareholders; better disclosure of costs in the investment chain; increased transparency and fairness in stock lending; and better alignment between pay and long-term performance.

Vince Cable said:


&quot;Many of us feel that in the past, our public companies and investors have focused on short-term profit at the expense of long-term value. The behaviour of many banks in the run up to the financial crisis is an extreme example of this quick buck mentality, but there is clearly a wider problem. That's why I asked John Kay to look at what could be done to ensure equity markets support good, long-term decision making. His insightful review calls for a shift in the culture of investment and sets a clear challenge to companies and those who invest in them.


&quot;His agenda is an ambitious one but I am very encouraged by the level of engagement we have seen already from investors. Not only on Kay's ideas, but through our directors' pay and shareholder voting reforms; in addressing diversity on corporate boards and through changes to the way companies report their business strategy and results. These actions will help restore trust in markets and in the system of capitalism on which our future prosperity depends.&quot;


The Kay Review, published in July, presented a compelling argument for market participants to change their behaviour and make investment decisions based on enhancing the performance of UK companies and supporting long-term growth, rather than maximising short-term gains.


The Government response looks in detail at each of the Kay Review's 17 recommendations and highlights the steps being taken to deliver them, either through specific policy measures or by business and industry working together to develop good practice.


Delivering on this agenda will require a sustained commitment from Government, regulators and others. The Government will publish an update in Summer 2014 setting out the progress achieved in delivering Professor Kay's recommendations and reporting how well companies and investors have stepped up to the plate.

  <summary type="text">(22/11/12) Vince Cable argues for an end to the focus on short-term returns among investors and sets out what the government is doing to foster a system of capitalism based on long-term value creation.



RESPONSIBLE CAPITALISM

 Introduction

 Good morning. It is no exaggeration to say the pensions industry is a lynchpin of the economy. Pension fund investments are a critical source of capital for UK companies, and potentially for infrastructure as well as savings vehicles.


Collectively, you hold over £150bn of UK equities. That figure illustrates the scale of your influence, but it goes much further than merely delivering returns to fund tomorrow's pensions for today's workers.


Careful husbandry over long timescales, a core duty for any pension fund, is an essential component in a system of responsible capitalism that encourages the pursuit of long-term value rather than short-run, sometimes illusory, returns.


So I would like to focus today on the work we are doing in government to support such a system - because it is clear we have a long way to go before we can say it exists.


Equity investment has become increasingly complex and intermediated, with more and more links in the chain. As a result, the different players are often working to their own agendas and timescales to the detriment of long-term value creation.


Too often, traders go after a quick buck rather than looking for sustainable returns based on sound stewardship of companies. Holdings are bought and sold to turn a short-term profit with no thought given to the underlying fundamentals.


This phantom chase was at its most frantic in the financial markets, where banks took dross and sold it as gold. But that lack of responsibility - the failure to take calculated investment risks based on sound principles - is more widespread.


Capitalism

 The issue of so called short-termism is part of a wider debate about capitalism and whether it should be constrained by a wider sense of responsibility. So, what do I mean by responsible capitalism? Let me explain by quoting Adam Smith, who said:


'It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.'


But Adam Smith himself was scathing about some forms of business behaviour - particularly those that led to the suppression of competition. He wrote &quot;people of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public.&quot;


I realise that there some irony in using this particular quote in a speech to a trade association conference. But Smith's conception of self-interest is distinct from the crude, material, selfishness we have seen. Elsewhere in his writings he discusses the notion of sympathy, or fellow feeling, and emphasises its importance. So Smith's butcher or baker cannot pursue their self-interest and obtain what they want without also meeting the needs of the customer. .


The pursuit of self-interest is not inherently irresponsible: the desire to trade and profit produced meat, beer and bread in Smith's day, and today has given us iPads, foreign holidays and life-saving drugs. What connects these things is their reliance on individuals acting in their own interests to deliver goods and services that benefit us all.


It is difficult to reconcile Smith's butcher, brewer and baker with the complexity of today's capitalism. Indeed the modern public company with dispersed shareholder ownership did not exist at that time. But they would have recognised the key role that trust and confidence play in effective markets. Without them, no economy can function effectively.


We have seen too many examples of irresponsible capitalism recently. Companies not paying their taxes. Employees making up the numbers or gambling the future of the entire company. Customers being sold complex products they neither need nor want. Managers helping themselves to lavish remuneration packages at the expense of customers, their shareholders and their workforce.


Sir Roger Carr, the CBI's President, acknowledged the problem at its annual conference on Monday. He said:


&quot;…standards have been variable, greed prevalent and fairness forgotten in a number of sectors - banking and media at the forefront - but others from all walks of life showing signs of bad behaviour.&quot;


As someone who found myself labelled &quot;anti-business&quot; for criticising the excesses of banking and media barons I empathise totally with Sir Roger. He, like me, is of course pro-business.


But like many in this room and in business we share a sense of dismay at some recent behaviour. I believe the majority of businesses play by the rules, pay their taxes and contribute to the economy. Where they don't, Government has a duty to intervene. But as owners, institutional investors have a major role in challenging and correcting this behaviour.


Our task together is to reform the system in order that trust is restored because, without it, the capitalist system cannot function effectively.


There are fundamental questions about why parts of the capitalist system have gone awry. At least part of the industry's problem is one of distorted perspective - a prevailing focus on the short term at the expense of the long-term.


The Kay Review

 This was the supposition which led me to invite John Kay to look at this problem in the round. And he has subjected the UK's equity markets to rigorous independent review with support from Sir John Rose, formerly of Rolls Royce, Chris Hitchen of Railpen and James Anderson of Baillie Gifford


His findings amount to a compelling argument that today's transactional cultures and the pursuit of short-term gains in financial markets are undermining the core responsibility of company directors and institutional investors to act as effective stewards of the assets they control.


The long-term pursuit of value creation has been crowded out by a focus on short-term gains.


Company directors have a clear legal responsibility to make decisions with regard to the long-term. This is part of their duty to promote the success of the company. Engagement by investors needs to change to support directors to meet this responsibility. The focus should be aligned with the timescales of the company's business model - which may be very long term.


And the stewardship relationship must be based on an understanding of company fundamentals. That's the best way to create an environment of trust and challenge, which enables those managing the company to take sound long-term decisions on investment and strategy.


John Kay found there is a particular problem in how the performance of active asset managers is currently measured. Faced with the need to deliver short-term performance, active asset managers will have an incentive to focus on what the market is doing - seeking to outperform other asset managers - rather than to engage with companies to understand and foster the creation of value.


So pension schemes and other asset holders need to issue clear mandates for active asset managers. They must set targets to achieve absolute returns that meet the needs of savers rather than just chasing the market.


That approach will send a strong signal that it's time the short-termism ended and was replaced by a clear-sighted focus on long-term value creation.


I am grateful to John for his cogent analysis of the problems in the corporate sector. Today I am publishing the Government's response to his review. It focuses on restoring relationships based on trust and confidence to the investment chain. The report has provoked constructive debate on many of the issues raised, and progress is being made on a number of the recommendations.


The Financial Reporting Council has revised the Stewardship Code to give a sharper emphasis on long-term company strategy, reinforcing the message that engagement has to be more than a box-ticking exercise. Instead, it requires genuine dialogue with companies about the long-term prospects for growth.


Investors are also recognising they need to engage collectively with companies. The review recommended an investor forum to maximise their influence, and there are encouraging signs that this will happen soon. I am happy to be a catalyst but it is not for government to create a new quango - a forum will only succeed if it is created and run by the investors it represents.


High on the to-do list for any forum is to tackle overly complex incentive schemes which encourage short-termism and tend to pay out asymmetrically. Some executives see spectacular rewards for good performance but there is no corresponding fall in pay when performance is poor.


John Kay called on companies and asset managers to change their own practices. Our reforms to executive pay - including giving shareholders a binding vote on pay policy for the first time - will support this by empowering investors to engage more effectively with companies.


We have come a long way in the last year. The shareholder spring has shown there is real appetite among shareholders to be much more challenging of unjustified pay awards.


The crucial factor is ensuring investors have the information they need to make long-term decisions, on pay and a range of other issues. John Kay was scathing about the effect of quarterly reporting on long-term investment. I agree with his analysis, and the government will work with our European counterparts to change the law so it is no longer required.


But there is a challenge here too for asset owners, including pension funds, who need to look beyond quarterly performance to judge their managers.


Our narrative reporting reforms, to encourage better quality annual reports that put the numbers into context, will help. The new rules, which come into force next year, will make reports simpler, more relevant and more focussed on forward looking strategy.


Trust is also the product of behaviour - a commitment to act with integrity and expect integrity from each other.


The term &quot;Fiduciary duty&quot; is used a lot in the debate on these issues, but it means different things to different people. We need clarity, with consistent standards of behaviour required throughout the investment chain.


So today we are making it clear that all intermediaries should act in good faith in the long-term interests of clients or beneficiaries.


These standards should be universal and immutable. We need to achieve them by making sure that our regulatory framework supports them - but also by promoting them as behavioural norms in the investment industry.


So we will ask the Financial Conduct Authority to consider whether their regulatory rules and approach support these standards and, where necessary, we will argue for changes to regulatory requirements at EU level.


In addition, we are asking the Law Commission to conduct a review of the legal obligations on investment intermediaries seeking to act in their clients' best interests - and to report back as soon as is practicable


Takeovers bring the discussion of duty and long-termism into particularly sharp focus. Company directors have a legal duty to promote the success of the company. A duty that requires that decisions be made with regard to the long-term consequences.


Company directors must recommend that shareholders reject a bid if they believe that the transaction will destroy long-term value, or that the premium being offered does not reflect the fundamental value of the company. Directors must give their best advice to shareholders. Shareholders must then decide what to do.


Owners and asset managers have a vital role here. In order to protect their long-term financial interests they must challenge management to explain the strategy and logic of large deals and provide robust, consistent push-back where they have concerns. Events continue to show it is as true for the shareholders in the bidding company as it is in the target.


I understand that the Takeover Panel are carrying out a review of the impacts of last year's changes to the Takeover Code. I look forward to seeing their findings, and their assessment of the progress that has been made.


In the light of the debate around takeovers in the wake of the Kraft acquisition of Cadbury, I was anxious to ensure that takeover activity should be subject to greater transparency over fee incomes, and that rules should not play into the hands of short-term speculative investors. I therefore welcomed the reforms by the Takeover Panel.


But Government also has a wider role to play here - particularly in strategically important sectors. This is recognised by the current legal framework, and we are not proposing to change it. It is important that companies focus on creating sustainable competitive advantage, not on complex merger and acquisition strategies that destroy shareholder value.


Takeovers are part of a wider context: the need to ensure that the bedrock of the capitalist system - the competitive market - functions as effectively as possible. The government is consequently strengthening the regulatory framework to create a single, powerful competition authority - the Competition and Markets Authority.


It will have a duty to promote competition for the benefit of consumers and will observe the principle of supporting long-term growth. This objective will be formally embedded in its performance framework.


We will also ensure that the Competition and Markets Authority works closely with sector regulators to more vigorously tackle competition issues in regulated sectors.


All of the areas I've discussed depend on effective engagement between companies and their owners for progress to be made. So to fuel to the cultural change that's required, we are endorsing John Kay's 'Principles for Equity Markets' - and the directions for market practice which flow from these.


In particular we have challenged leading industry bodies - including the NAPF - to review the report's Good Practice Statements. I am delighted the NAPF has accepted this challenge.


And to measure the headway we are making on John Kay's recommendations we will publish a progress check in eighteen months' time, setting out how Government has taken forward the recommendations and how well companies and investors have stepped up to the plate.


Industrial Strategy and Financial Services

 There are other major policies afoot which have at their heart an attempt to inject a more long term approach to business decision making. One is the industrial strategy in which we sit down with sectors like aerospace, life sciences, automobiles, energy supply chains, and others to plan the long term implications for skill development, technological change and innovation and procurement.


Another is financial services. Tim Breedon's recent review for me found the UK has one of the most sophisticated financial centres in the world. But UK businesses outside the financial sector aren't getting the benefit from this. There is a kind of enclave development unconnected with the real economy.


One specific example is that while the City can provide a range of sophisticated services to international business, British medium and small companies cannot get long-term, patient capital for love nor money.


So, we need to fundamentally change the system so the financial services industry serves businesses, and not the contrary.


We are taking a number of steps to reform the banking industry, but we need to go further and reshape the business finance market. That is why I have announced the creation of a business bank that will have as its core mission to stimulate competition in the business finance markets and make them work for businesses.


With a clean balance sheet, and £1bn worth of funding, this bank will be tasked with expanding lending and investment to the manufacturers, exporters and high growth companies that power our economy, in particular addressing the need for long-term, patient capital.


We will shortly announce the appointment of an advisory group for the bank. Its task will be to help shape the design and its future activities


Wider work

 There are many other areas that will help promote long termism, and truly responsible capitalism, such as greater diversity in workforces - especially in the boardroom, the growth of social enterprise and alternative models such as employee ownership and mutuals. I cannot hope to go into detail on all of these areas in this speech, but we are making good progress


Conclusion

 This then, is the government's clear priority - ensuring we have a market economy rooted in a system of responsible capitalism. Expectations of the market system have changed since the financial crisis - after paying for its reconstruction, UK citizens must see and share in the benefits of recovery and growth.


The far-reaching reforms I have discussed today will help, but they are the start of a much longer process. One that requires a change in attitude and behaviour among key players in the system.


Many companies are beginning to recognise this, and are investing in jobs, skills, supply chain development, and other areas that will help create long-term value.


It is only by responding to these concerns that we can restore trust in markets - and as major shareholders you are in a uniquely strong position to help achieve that.

  <summary type="text">Empowering Youth in conjunction with Orleans House presented an exhibition of artwork last weekend for the Richmond Literature Festival. Opened by Local MP Vince Cable, works of art by students from TwickenhamAcademy were displayed under the title 'The Power of Imagination'
The project showed the thoughts, feelings and emotions of students, captured in expressive abstract art, in which they were encouraged to be experiment with techniques such as marbling, painting and scratching. Wood artist Derek Pearce created beautiful hand-carved panels with quotes from great world thinkers to accompany the work, which helped inspire the student's creativity.</summary>

<p>The event was a great success, celebrating young people, their position in our community and the magic of art and writing. With Cllr Fleming, the artists parents, staff of TwickenhamAcademy and members of our community also in attendance.</p>
<p>Dr Cable said, "I was very impressed with the creativity from the students at TwickenhamAcademy, and having a pubic exhibition with local art is a real achievement for the community."</p>
